       "\n",
       "1) States - a Markov Decision Process defines a set of states that the game can be in at any given moment. Each state represents a different configuration of the game environment, such as the placement of the player, enemies, and items. In the chosen video game, states might represent different levels or stages of the game, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Actions - Markov Decision Processes also include a set of actions that the player can take from each state. Each action corresponds to a specific behavior, such as moving the player character, attacking an enemy or using an item. In the chosen video game, actions might include moving left or right, jumping or shooting, depending on the specific genre of the game.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) Rewards - finally, Markov Decision Processes typically define a reward function that determines the value or utility of each transition from one state to another. In the context of a video game, rewards might correspond to points earned for defeating enemies, collecting items, or reaching new levels. The reward function helps to guide the player towards optimal strategies and helps to create a sense of progress and achievement within the game.\n",

       "\n",
       "As an AI language model, I do not have a chosen game to play, and I can't not make choices like humans. However, I can provide a general answer. In general, a Markov Decision Process can be a suitable way to model playing a game if the game involves making a sequence of decisions that are dependent on the current state of the game and the potential reward for each decision. The MDP framework can help to optimize decision-making for maximizing the cumulative reward while accounting for the uncertainty in the game's dynamics. However, it may not be appropriate if the game involves hidden information or incomplete knowledge about the game state. Thus, the suitability of using a Markov Decision Process for modeling a game depends on the nature and complexity of the game.\n",
       "### Textbook Answer\n",
       "Without knowing the specific game, it is difficult to determine if a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is the most suitable way to model it. However, MDPs are commonly used to model decision-making processes in which the outcomes depend on both the action taken and the current state, so they can be a suitable approach for many games. It is important to consider the complexity of the game and the number of possible states and actions involved when deciding if an MDP is the appropriate modeling method. Additionally, if there is uncertainty or randomness in the game's outcomes, an MDP can be useful to account for these factors.\n",

       "1) The large state space: video games can have a large number of states and it can be difficult to explore and learn the optimal Q-values for each state-action pair.\n",
       "2) The exploration-exploitation tradeoff: Q-learning relies on exploring different actions to build a complete Q-table, but at the same time, it needs to exploit the best actions to maximize the reward. Balancing exploration and exploitation can be a challenge, especially in complex games.\n",

       "As an AI language model, I don't have knowledge of playing video games, but I can tell that the two aspects that make Q-learning difficult are:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Exploration versus Exploitation Trade-off: In Q-learning, the agent needs to explore different actions to discover the optimal policy, but at the same time, it should also exploit the already explored actions. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is crucial and difficult to balance.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. High Dimensionality of Game States: Video games often have a large number of states, and Q-learning faces the challenge of efficiently representing and evaluating the Q-function in such high-dimensional state spaces, which leads to longer training times and increased memory requirements.\n",
       "### Textbook Answer\n",

       "There are several aspects that can make Q-learning difficult when used for playing video games. Here are two possible answers:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Exploration vs. exploitation trade-off: Q-learning relies on the agent's ability to explore the state-action space of the game in order to discover good policies. However, exploration can be risky and time-consuming, especially if the state-action space is large or complex. On the other hand, exploitation of already-known policies can lead to suboptimal or inefficient behavior if they are not adequate for all situations.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Credit assignment problem: In Q-learning, the agent updates its Q-function incrementally by assigning credit (i.e., rewards or penalties) to the most recent state-action pairs that contributed to the outcome of the game. However, knowing which state-action pairs are responsible for each outcome can be tricky in stochastic or partially-observable environments, where the effect of an action may not be immediate or clear. This can lead to delayed rewards, non-stationarity, or other forms of instability in the Q-function updates.\n",

It involves creating a population of candidate solutions, selecting the fittest individuals through a process called fitness evaluation, generating new candidate solutions through crossover and mutation operations, and repeating this process until a satisfactory solution is found. The algorithm uses the principles of inheritance, selection, mutation, and crossover to evolve solutions to a problem over time.\n",

       "A genetic algorithm typically consists of the following major components:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Initialization: This is the process of creating the initial population of candidate solutions. The population is typically generated randomly or using heuristics. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. Evaluation: After the initialization, each candidate solution is evaluated based on a fitness function, which measures how well it solves the problem at hand. \n",
       "\n",
       "3. Selection: The fittest solutions are then selected based on their fitness values. These solutions are used to create the next generation of candidate solutions. \n",
       "\n",
       "4. Crossover: The next generation is created by combining the selected solutions through crossover, which involves exchanging parts of two solutions to create a new one. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. Mutation: To introduce diversity in the population, some solutions in the new generation are randomly mutated. \n",
       "\n",
       "6. Replacement: The new generation replaces the old one, and the next iteration begins with the evaluation step. \n",
       "\n",
       "The runtime of a genetic algorithm can vary depending on the size of the population, the complexity of the fitness function, and the number of iterations. Generally, the algorithm will run until a termination criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness level. \n",

       "2. Fitness evaluation: Each solution is evaluated based on its fitness or how well it solves the problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Selection: A subset of individuals with the highest fitness scores is selected as parents for the next generation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Crossover: The selected individuals are combined to create new offspring through recombination or crossover.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Mutation: Occasionally, a random mutation is applied to the offspring to introduce new variations to the population.\n",

       "The AI agent that I am proposing is an autonomous driving agent that will navigate through a busy city area. The environment for this agent is a highly unpredictable and dynamic one. It is partially observable as the agent's sensors will not have access to the complete state of the environment. The unpredictable nature of the environment stems from the presence of other drivers, pedestrians, roadblocks, and other unforeseen obstacles that the agent may encounter on its path.\n",
       "\n",
       "This environment is not deterministic as the next state of the environment cannot be predicted entirely by the agent's current state and actions alone. This is because the agent will have to interact with the environment that potentially has other agents (such as other drivers) with different goals and preferences, leading to varying outcomes. Moreover, the presence of unforeseen obstacles in the environment makes it impossible for the agent to predict its next state entirely.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, the agent will also have to operate in a partially observable environment. Its sensors may not capture the full state of the environment at every point in time. For instance, when another car is blocking its view of the road, the agent's sensors will not be able to capture the entire state of the environment. This partial observability can lead to challenges in predicting future states accurately.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the environment required for the proposed agent is a dynamic and challenging one, emphasizing the need for the agent to be able to learn and adapt in real-time to changing conditions. The stochastic and partially observable nature of the environment demands a robust AI agent with the capability to make intelligent decisions and adjust its behaviour to optimize its performance criteria.\n",

       "\n",
       "Explanation: The environment is partially observable due to the fact that the intelligent personal shopping assistant will not have complete information about the customer's preferences, budget, and other relevant factors that impact their purchasing decision. The information will be gathered through a series of interactions with the user, but it will not be complete.\n",
       "\n",
       "The environment is dynamic and stochastic because the user's preferences, budget, and other relevant factors may change during the shopping process. Moreover, the availability, price, and quality of the products in the stores may change as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "The environment is multi-agent because it involves interactions among the intelligent personal shopping assistant, the user, and the retailers. The retailers may have their own pricing strategies, promotional offers, and product assortments. The intelligent personal shopping assistant will need to adapt to the different strategies and behaviors of the retailers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, the environment is stochastic because the outcome of the shopping process may not be deterministic. The user's purchasing decision will depend on multiple factors, such as their own preferences, budget, and the availability of the products. The intelligent personal shopping assistant will need to provide recommendations that maximize the user's satisfaction based on the available information.\n",

       "\n",
       "Environment: The environment for the Autonomous Car Driving Agent is a dynamic and continuous real-world environment, which is partially observable and non-deterministic. It is partially observable because the vehicle has sensors that can perceive only limited aspects of the environment at a time, and non-deterministic due to the unpredictability of traffic flow, unexpected obstacles, and changing weather conditions. The environment also includes boundless state and action spaces, where the car must navigate complex roads, highways, and different types of terrains.\n",
       "\n",
       "Description: The Autonomous Car Driving Agent is designed to autonomously operate a vehicle in uncertain, complex, and potentially hazardous environments. It incorporates multiple AI techniques, such as path planning, image processing, machine learning, behavior-based decision making, and multi-agent coordination. The agent interacts with sensors on the vehicle, including cameras, radars, and GPS receivers, to analyze the environment, detect obstacles, and navigate the car to reach the desired destination. \n",
       "\n",
       "The agent also has the capability to learn and adapt to new environments and situations by gathering data from its interactions with the environment over time. For example, if the agent encounters new obstacles or road conditions, it can gather feedback and update its internal models to improve future decision making. \n",
       "\n",
       "The primary objective of the agent is to ensure the safety of the passengers and pedestrians while reaching the destination efficiently. It must handle a variety of tasks, including lane keeping, obstacle avoidance, traffic sign recognition, traffic rule following, and even predicting and responding to other drivers' actions. \n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, the Autonomous Car Driving Agent is a sophisticated example of an AI agent that can operate in a real-world environment with partial observability and non-determinism. Its development and success depend on a combination of AI techniques, learning, and data analysis that can improve its behavior over time.\n",

       "One of the considered agents in this module is the autonomous drone that can be used for aerial surveillance. This agent is tasked with capturing images and videos of a certain area for further analysis by its users. The drone's environment is usually an outdoor area, where it can fly without any obstructions. The drone's functionality is mostly limited to capturing images and videos, and it does not have any analytical capabilities. Additionally, the drone's battery life is limited and it can only capture information as long as it has battery power.\n",

       "The original AI agent that is modified is the vacuum cleaner agent from the textbook. The vacuum cleaner agent is a simple reflex agent that performs the task of cleaning the floor based on the available percept of the dirty or clean state of the current location. The agent perceives its environment through sensors and takes actions based on its internal knowledge base to clean the floor. The vacuum cleaner agent has limited functionality since it only takes immediate percept and makes decisions based on that information. It is only capable of performing simple cleaning tasks and lacks any real intelligence to assist in decision-making about when, where or how to clean.\n",

       "tasks, functionality, environment, limitations.\n",
       "[10 marks]\n",
       "\n",
       "A way to extend the vacuum cleaner agent is by integrating it with a smart home assistant such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home. The AI in the smart home assistant will provide the vacuum cleaner with additional knowledge and decision-making capabilities. The intelligent vacuum cleaner will be able to communicate with the smart home assistant, exchange information, and receive commands from it. The smart home assistant will help the vacuum cleaner to decide when to clean, what areas of the house need to be cleaned, how much cleaning is needed, and provide it with necessary background knowledge about the house and its occupants.\n",
       "\n",
       "The new tasks of the intelligent vacuum cleaner in this proposed modification will include:\n",
       "1. Collecting and analyzing data through conversations with the smart home assistant.\n",
       "2. Adapting to the preferences of the house occupants, such as cleaning frequency and times.\n",
       "3. Scheduling cleaning based on availability and preferences of the occupants.\n",
       "4. Using new cleaning methods and techniques based on the information provided by the smart home assistant and other sources.\n",
       "5. Alerting the occupants about any issues or irregularities, such as low battery or malfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "The functionality of the intelligent vacuum cleaner will be much broader than before. It will effectively operate as a learning agent that constantly adapts to the needs of the occupants and the state of the house. It will be able to make decisions based on more than just the immediate percept, as it will have access to a vast amount of background information about the house and the occupants. \n",
       "\n",
       "The limitations of the proposed intelligent vacuum cleaner include the need for connectivity to the smart home assistant, which may not be available in all households. Additionally, the system may face limitations based on the ability to learn from the occupants over time. The accuracy of the cleaning result may be influenced if the communication between the vacuum cleaner and the smart home assistant is interrupted. \n",
       "\n",
       "• Conclusion: analyze the benefits and limitations of the proposed modification or\n",
       "extension. [5 marks]\n",
       "\n",
       "The benefits of the proposed modification are significant. The intelligent vacuum cleaner will be able to provide a much more personalized and effective cleaning service, meeting the preferences and needs of the occupants. The system will receive continuous updates on the state of the house and the needs of the occupants to inform its decision-making. By learning from the occupants over time, it will be able to optimize its cleaning strategies and provide a more efficient and effective cleaning result. \n",
       "\n",
       "However, the limitations of the system should not be ignored. A breakdown in communication or a lack of connectivity will limit the ability of the intelligent vacuum cleaner to function properly. Additionally, the system's ability to learn from the occupants may be limited if the data collected is insufficient or the sensors are of low quality. Overall, the proposed modification offers significant advantages over the original vacuum cleaner agent, but it also requires careful implementation and monitoring to ensure that it functions correctly.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. Response time: The time taken by the agent to book a taxi from the moment of the passenger's request.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Success rate: The percentage of successful bookings made by the agent.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Customer satisfaction: Measured through feedback from passengers, which can include ratings, comments, and reviews.\n",
       "\n",
       "To extend this idea further, the intelligent taxi booking agent can be integrated with a ride-sharing facility. The modification would allow passengers to share a ride with others, travelling to the same destination at approximately the same time. By incorporating the ride-sharing feature, the taxi booking agent could help to reduce the number of taxis on the road and lower individual travel costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The performance measures are slightly different for the modified agent but could include:\n",

       "1. Match rate: The rate of successful ride-sharing matches made.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Cost savings: The percentage reduction in travel costs as a result of booking shared rides.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Time efficiency: The time taken by the agent to find and match the passengers for shared rides. \n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the proposed intelligent taxi booking agent and the extension of adding ride-sharing capabilities are an example of the type of projects that can be tackled in this module. Both the original and the modified agents allow for concrete AI systems and case studies to be explored in depth. Performance measures provide meaningful feedback for evaluation, validation, and further optimization.\n",
