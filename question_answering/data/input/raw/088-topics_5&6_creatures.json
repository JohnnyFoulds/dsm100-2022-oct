  "transcript": "[music]Here we are at the end of Week 5.This is more or less the end of the Creatures Case Study.Just to say congratulations on working your way through this.I hope you've enjoyed this deep diveinto genetic algorithms and evolving morphologies.Really, for me, this has been such a great journey.I've really enjoyed developing and explaining to you the artof genetic algorithms, which is something I havea personal interest in and having studied it in depth in my PhD.It being one of the things that really got me into programmingand computer sciencein a really intense way back when I did my master's coursewhere I worked on artificial life systems and genetic algorithms.Let's look at the learning objectives.Now, having finished Week 5 in this particular part of the course,we should be able to select and explain examples of state-of-the-artin evolutionary computing.We should now have that having built oneof these things in depth from scratch.We now have a real insight intohow the guts of them are, how do they really work?You should be able to discussthe challenges of the field of evolutionary and bioinspired computing.What are the things that people are really trying to do at the moment?Looking at those evolving deep networksand those really heavy computational tasksand trying to make those more efficientand see if they can compete with the behemoth of deep learningusing these bioinspired techniques which,in a way, are much more nimbleand can potentially really revolutionizethe way that deep learning is done.Indeed, some of these systems are working towards that.Well done in reaching the end of the Creatures Case Study.As I said, I really hope you've enjoyed it.I've really enjoyed explaining all this stuff to you, and hopefully,my passion for the subject has come across and you found it engagingand there wasn't too much programming.If there was, that you were ableto skip it and catch up in the lab worksheets.Well done.You've reached the end of the Creatures Case Study."
