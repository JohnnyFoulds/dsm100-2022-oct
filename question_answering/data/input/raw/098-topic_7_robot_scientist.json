  "transcript": "[music]In this demo video,I will show you how to walk witha toy robot scientist in a visual studio.First of all, we will look at the main file,main Bison,and then we will talk about knowledge modeland then knowledge agent.Main Bison file is the main entry point to all other files.Here we have console menu,it is a library that allows youto have some simple user-friendly interface.It is available as an open-sourceand it's not a full-fledge do graphic user interface but it's still good to haveand support, and you see when you run it,it generates you key menu optionsthat you can navigate using these options.If you don't have it, you can install using.PIP and then we also input OSS library.Now, OSS library, it is for working with bars.It just makes easier navigation to allour other files like experimental protocol,experimental results, or our data outputs.It is very helpful to have, and also you can install it.We have several files that are essentially functions likeknowledge model, abduction reasoning plan, and so on.Their functions and they can be called, sources files will be called.They will be used for these menu options.We create menu first,so these are our parts,and here we create menu options.We have five options and six exit and we create it here.Then, we can add these items to the menu,and we can initialize it.This is how interface is organized.Now we can call menu show.Now, if we press one,we initializethe knowledge agent.Let's go to model agent and see how it is all organized here.The knowledge agent when we press one,it initiates this knowledgeand there's a script this and this file knowledge model.We will use RDFLib library that is specificallydesigned to walk with RDF files.We created our knowledge model or it can be somewhere externally.You can take any file, RDF file.This library enables you to process it in Bison.This is how agents can communicate and pass information between each other,so knowledge agent works with RDF representation,but it's possible to represent it in Bison too.It's okay to file the book directly here.In this demo, I would like to show you how RDF files can be parsedand this RDF file can be locally on your computeror it can be externally anywhere,just specifies the parse to it.RDForm library is quite rich library.It has rich functionality, for example,it enables SPARQL queries over RDF Triplets.A SPARQL, it's like SQL queries for databasesbut it is for RDF knowledge models,but we will not touch on it.Here, we'll use graph.This is the main interfacethat enables us to parse RDF files,and we also just go to simple visualization.Here, we just make our life easier by using OSS as specifyingall our parse to data to RDFso where is it and also where is image is.Now, we initialize graphs or knowledge graph, for that,we call this graph function.Then what we door what we do we just parse our file.This is parse to our file, again, it can be localor it can be external and you can play with it,just put any valid RDF fileand valid link to that file.Here, also format, so RDF cause many variants,it can be XML, it can be total,in here, it is XML.All over this happening, it's just loops through all these tripletsand then prints them.We can see that it is being processed,but also count how many triplets there and some image.Let's see, in our output so yes.Let's press something to come back,and let's press one again, so that you see,so yes, we got this image, is not dynamic,it is what is inside RDF fileand it is like conceptual model.We have chemical compounds and we have six of them.We have two toxins, we have two drugs,and we have this defined cause and small molecule.Here, you see these properties molecular weight,and also define some other properties, but we didn't use them in our example.This is the image, once again, if you modifyknowledge model so you can modify,you can add triples, remove triples, but it will not be reflected here.It's just an image generated by WebVOWL.Let's go back.That also shows that it has 74 entries,so this gives us confidence that it can process everything correctly.In a [?] demo, we looked inside the main file.We talked about how menu for our toy robot scientist is organized.These key options that corresponds to key agents,and we looked inside one agent, knowledge agent.This agent can process knowledge modelso models that create it somewhere else.Or, alternatively, it can probably just haveas these triplets encoded in by symbols.That is not so much advisable, so it's better to use somethingwhat is designed to work this knowledge models and then input to Bison.Or strictly follow the logic set was checkedin some special phonology presentation tools.I hope now you can work with RDFLib libraryand you'll also find useful information about other libraries,like console menu and [?]."
