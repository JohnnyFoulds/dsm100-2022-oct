  "transcript": "[music]-Welcome to Week 1 of the [?] case study.Let's jump onto the learning objectives for this week.Essentially, at the end of this week,you're going to be able to explain the key features of a genetic algorithmand explain how they can be used to address a given problem.Secondly, we're going to be able to compareand contrast examples of artificial life systems.Thirdly, we're going to be able to develop an argumentabout the potential of evolutionary and bio-inspired computing.That's the basics but just checking this diagram up here,this is something we're going to encounter laterand it's a key feature of the genetic algorithm,which is the idea of variation.You can see you've got different shapes in there,and different selective power for the different shapes.It's a very simple diagram, but it summarizesa lot of the features of the genetic algorithmthat we're going to see in the next few videos.Good luck this week."
