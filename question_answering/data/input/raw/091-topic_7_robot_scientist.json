  "transcript": "AI is increasingly affectingmore and more areas of life.One such area is scientific research.The application of AI to scienceis called scientific discovery.As in other AI application areas,there are three technological trendsdriving progress.Computers are gettingfaster and faster by integratingmore processors on chips.There is more and more data availablefor AI systems to work with.New and better AI softwareis being developed,especially in the area of machine learning.The history of AI is one of boomswith overly optimistic expectations,and busts, so-called AI winters,overly pessimistic disillusionment.In the past, AI experts have madeembarrassingly over-optimisticpredictions about how fast things will develop.However, as someone who has worked in AIfor over 30 years,I have recently been surprised abouthow fast things have been developing.One thing that is different nowis how central is to the most valuabletech companies in the world,Google, Facebook, Amazon,and their Chinese rivals.Vast fortunes are being made using AI,especially machine learning.AI systems have superhumanscientific reasoning powers.They can flawlessly remembervast numbers of facts,execute flawless logical reasoning,execute near-opticalprobabilistic reasoning,learn more rationally than humans,learn from vast amounts of data,extract informationfrom millions of scientific papers.I argue that AI is a wonderfulapplication area for science.Scientific problems are abstract,like games such as chess and goal,but science also involves the real world.Scientific problemsare restricted in scope.By this I mean that to be goodat science AI systems don't necessarilyneed to know about anything elsebut science.Another advantage is that nature is honest,not malicious.By this I mean that if a humanor a robot scientist does an experiment,we are confident that experimental resultsare not contrived by nature to mislead.This is not the casewith many other applications of AI,such as in economics warfare, et cetera.Nature is also a worthy object of our study.In my view, it is a tragedythat given the many problems in the worldwhich AI could potentially help,global warming, diseases,food shortages, et cetera,that so much AI talent is being usedto develop more addictive advertising,to develop better weapons, et cetera.I also believe that the generationof scientific knowledge,as long as it is in the public domain, is a public good."
