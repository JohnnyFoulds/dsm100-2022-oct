  "transcript": "[music]-Welcome to the AI module.My name is Larisa Soldatova, and I am the module author,and here with me is Dr. Matthew Yee-King,who is co-author of this module.-Hello.-The module is divided in two parts.First part, first four topics are of more theoretical nature,and the last six topics are devoted to concrete case studies.I prepared one case study, and Matthew prepared two case studies.I will now ask Matthew to introduce himselfand tell about his cases.-Okay. Thanks, Larisa.The two case studies I've worked on are the artificial creaturesand the game playing AI, but before I talk about those,I should introduce myself and say that the reasonI've chosen those two case studies is I've worked for many yearsas an AI scientist and a research engineer and various other thingson different research projects.I'm currently a member of faculty in the Goldsmiths Computing Departmentand also the course director for the online BSC computer science.To go back to the case studies, the first one, as I say,is evolving creatures, and what that involvesis essentially a deep dive where we recreate line by line in code,a very famous research paper from the mid-'90s,which demonstrated one of the first times really the power of automated designusing artificial intelligence techniques.It's a great paper, and I think you'll really enjoyseeing that thing built up.I'm not going to give too much away,but you'll see some pretty interesting thingscrawling around on your screen when you work through that case study.Then, the second case study is another recreationof a famous research paper, this time from 2015.This paper was by DeepMind, who you may well have heard of,and in this paper, what they did is they developedan AI agent which can play video games,and they demonstrated that it was able to play multiple different video gamesat the standard of human expert players,which was really a big hit at the timein the Nature magazine when it was published.Those are my two case studies,so I'm going to hand them back to Larisa now.-Thank you.In my case study,we will talk about the robot scientist system,how it generates new knowledge,how it can come up with new ideas, new hypotheses,and test them.We will look inside the systemwith components it has and how they interact.As a whole,this module covers a wide range of AI techniques,and we are considering them on these concrete case studies.I hope that by the end of this module,you will be able to master these techniquesand apply them for your tasks.I wish you very best of luck with studying this module.-Good luck."
