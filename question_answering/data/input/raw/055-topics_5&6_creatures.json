  "transcript": "In this video, we're going to load up one of the pre-set robotsthat comes with PyBullet and move its joints to seewhat happens just as a sort of experiment.What we're going to do is, first of all, look at getting the joint info,so we're going to load the model and get the joint info,then we're going to iterate over the jointsand see what we can do with them,and then we're going to switch on all the motors and see what happens.It'll be a quick video.Remember, we've got these two functions, getNumJoints and getJointInfo.What I'm going to do is,I am going to fire up my environment here.I found that there's  an interesting robot modelcalled the humanoid robot.I'm going to load that one in.We can see that-- there it is,  it's not really obvious,it's kind of half a humanoid  at the momentso if I do set real-time on here, there we go.There's our humanoid robot.You can see, it's kind of got the legs, and arms, and head as you'd expect.Now the question is, how many joints does it have and can we move them?If I do p.get a number of joints,it gave me lots of warnings, it's not that happy.It's Rob3.Number of joints on rob3.Let's see, how many joints does it have?It's got 15 joints, and if I iterate over those joints and print out the types,remember we've got these joint types which are JOINT_REVOLUTE,and JOINT_PRISMATIC, AND JOINT_FIXED.Those are the available joints so if we iterate over the number of joints,which is 15,and I do print(p.getJointInfo(rob3,i)and I'm going to filter it down,  I'm just going to select the--You can see I'm going to do the select of just the third item in the array,which is the joint type.Hopefully-- yes, there we go.We can see  that's printing out of those 15 joints,all the different types that we got.We got some fours, twos, and zeros.Four is the fixed, there are a few fixed ones in there.There are some twos as well,I don't know what twos are, but they don't-- [?] supported.Maybe that's a prismatic joint or something.Possibly, it's what those warnings were about, if we go back,probably not too happy.Anyway, that's my model loaded in.Those are my joint infos.Now, how do I go about actually switching the motors on?Well, I'm just going to iterate  over them and just dop.setJointMotorControl2,and I'm going to do Rob3,  which is the name--idea of my robot, the joint id is going to be i,and then the control mode, I'm going to set it to velocity modes.I don't know if you can remember what velocity mode means?We've got position mode  and velocity mode.Velocity mode is when you just basically switch the speed on the motor,switch the motor on and leave it running.I'm going to do p.dot velocity control  and target velocity.I'm going to set it to something like reasonably not too high.That code there is going to iterate through all the joints in the robotand switch them on, hopefully.Something's happening.You can see, the arm seemed to be moving but not much else.Now, interestingly, you'll notice it's kind of moving that way.Maybe there are some constraints on the legs to prevent them from movingbecause obviously, my arms don't go that way, do they?They only go that way.These ones arms are able so  if I set the velocity to -0.25 instead,like this, hopefully the legs will start moving.Now we got some interesting stuff going on.It is now bending its legs  and doing some weird stuff there.You can see that we can basically switch all of the motors on and things startskind of articulating like that.I'm guessing that the spherical joints,on the arms there, on the shoulders,  andpossibly on the hips,which is why they're not moving  how we'd expectbecause you have to move them in a different way.Anyway, that's really what I wanted to show you, to be honest.That's plenty.That is just a quick demonstration of how you can control a pre-set robotby sort of getting the joint info,having a poke around, seeing what kind of joints it hasiterating over the joints, switching all the motors onand just trying different directions  to see what it doesand obviously, you can go and try out  some of those pre-set modelsto see how well they work for you.Just in summary, this video we've just been looking at how we can switchall the motors on in a pre-set model  and how it then moves."
