  "transcript": "[music]-In this mini-lecture,we will talk about how induction can be employed for hypothesis generation.Induction is a mechanism that enables us to generalize factsto formulate new rules.Inductive inference requires further testing and verification.We will consider how robot scientists can use inductionto formulate new hypothesis.In induction, we have several facts.For example, Daffy is a swan and white.Tweety is a swan and white.We can induce a general rule.All swans are white.The rule is not guaranteed to be correct.A verification step is required.Even after more observations and experimentations,we still can't be completely sure that the new rule is correctunless we can inspect all the instances.Nevertheless, it is how we form our understanding about the rules that are around us.We observe, experiment, and generalize,and we tend to overgeneralize.Remember, our knowledge is not perfect.There is a lot we still don't know.Even well-established series like Newtonian mechanicscan be overturned by the theory of relativity.Machine learning is essentially based on inductive reasoning.It takes us input many data points,identifies patterns in the data, and then generalizes them to unseen new data.For example, if many three-bedroom houses in Brightonwere sold for 300K to 350K,then a prediction in the near future of the three-bedroom houseswill be sold for the same money makes sense.Such predictions are not necessarily correct as with any inductive reasoningbut often, they are, because the world we live in is stable enough. It is possible to estimate the accuracy of predictions,but it all works only if nothing extraordinary happenlike a real estate bubble.Inductive reasoning is widely used in biomedical research.One of the reasons for its success is that biology is remarkably conservative.Many gene functions are preserved across many species including humans.Many genetic factors that are correct for budding yeastare also correct for humans.Genes in different organisms are not exactly the same,but they are similar enough for inductive inference.For example,Gene X has function Y in cerevisiae,it's yeast.Gene X has function Y in C. elegance.Some generalization of these facts can be,Gene X has function Y in all organisms,and therefore, Gene X has function Y in Homo sapiens.Of course, it's not guaranteed to be correct and further experimentation is required.I will give you an example of SIRT genes, sirtuins.They have been shown to regulate organismal lifespan.Abundance of sirtuins has been first reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast,and then in several other model organisms,in nematodes and fruit flies.The reasoning behind this research is induction.If something is true for yeast, it may be true for other organisms.For example, Kim et al ran experiments in zebrafish,and discovered that the absence of longevity gene SIRT1 in zebrafishleads to oxidative injury, chronic inflammation, and reduced lifespan.Not surprisingly, scientists are investigatinghow sirtuins affecting longevity in humans?Robot scientists also use induction to formulate hypothesisabout gene functions and potential drugs.In this mini-lecture,we discuss the use of induction for hypothesis generation.Inductive reasoning is probably the most widely used type of reasoningin scientific research.For example, in biology,hat is true for one organism, it can be true for another organism,including humans."
