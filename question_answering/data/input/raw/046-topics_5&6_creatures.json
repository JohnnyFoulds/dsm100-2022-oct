  "transcript": "[music]-In this video, I'm going to be talking about Karl Sims' creatures,which is quite a famous paper about genetic algorithmsand evolving morphology.In summary, I'm going to, first of all, explain what evolvingmorphology actually is.We're going to talk about Sims' creatures and how he defined morphologyin this system,and also how he defined a control system for the creatures.Then we're going to talk about the simulationthat he used to assess the creatures and the fitness functionsand how they were evolved through mutation and population models.Let's start by talking about evolving morphology.Before we get into that, I'll just say that it is,for me, the inspiration point here is probably Dawkins' biomorphs.That's one of the earlier papers where a clear attempt was madeto use a genetic algorithm to evolve form.Dawkins actually was using it in his blind watchmaker bookas a demonstration or a proof if you like that,with a very simple algorithm, which has an evolutionary feel to it,you can evolve very complicated forms quicklyin order to build on the argument that evolutionis capable of generating really complicated thingsover a long time period.You don't need an intelligent designer.That was Dawkins' angle on it.Just to explain what Dawkins' biomorphs was,to draw it, you would start by basically saying, well--You get a bunch of variations.You get a bunch of different creatures that look like,say this and maybe another one would look like that.One might look like that.You get a bunch of different creatures.It's the idea of variation in the population.Then as the human operator of the program, you would say,\"Okay, I like the look of that one and I want to make variationson that.\"Then it would basically generate the next generation for you,which would be based on that.You'd end up with, maybe extra joints on the legsor something like that.Very quickly, over a few iterations Dawkins was able to showthat it was possible to come up with very elaborateand natural-looking forms just through this processof interactive evolution using interactive genetic algorithms.That's what, evolving morphology--It's a really good example of it and a basic version,which was used to make a philosophical point if you like.The next thing we want to talk about is Sims creatures.It's a big development of this into three dimensions.What I want to do is just quickly run a simulation here.Whoops, let me just run thatand I'll zoom in so we can see it.There's the creature.What you can see here is an evolved creature.What it's doing is it's moving its various weird joints aroundso that it can ambulate along.It's figured out a way of moving along by itself.It's exploiting features of the physics engineto jump in the air by pushing itself off and things like that.That's not Sims' creatures though,but it looks like it because, for copyright reasons,I'm not really allowed to show you, the actual original videosof Sims' creatures.If you go onto YouTube and search for Karl Sims' creatures,you'll very quickly find it and have a lookand you'll see it quite similar, look into that one,but that gives you the idea.The idea is we are evolving a 3D morphology.Let's just read the first paragraph from Sims' paper.This paper describes a novel system for creating virtual creatures that moveand behave in simulated three-dimensional physical worlds.It's basically about evolving creatures that existin a simulated physical world and they move and behave,behave bit is interesting.We'll come back to that in a minute.The question is, how does it all work?How did you do it?This is 1994 just to say.When I first started studying a life, which is when I did my master's degreein 1998I was introduced to this paper.It was only four years old at the time.It was reasonably fresh as a state of the art.This is amazing work and it was so--It made a big impression on me at the time,because I'd come from a biological sciences background.To see a fully working, evolving simulated evolution system,it was really, really impressive.How does it work? Well, it's got two parts.You've got the morphology of the creature and you've got the control systemfor the creature.Let me just explain with another drawing, how the morphology works.It's a directed graph.In other words, we've got something like this where we have nodesand the nodes are connected together.What we do is we basically have a graph like that.If you had a simple graph like that, and you turn that into a structurefor a creature,you would end up with the shape, it could be different shapes,but basically let's say, just to differentiate between the graphon the left and the creature you'd end up with a creaturethat's basically three bits connected together.That's not particularly interesting, right?It's pretty obvious mapping between one to the other,but the graph can also have recursion in it so it can connect back to itselfand it can have multiple connections.Let's consider those two things.First of all multiple connections.If I had one like this,where we have two connections,and then maybe that one connects to one as well.That would mean that I actually end up with a structure like this,with two connections coming off of it, and then two copies of that, oops, sorry.That's supposed to be a square, two copies of the thing.That goes to that and that goes to thatand thatbecause we've got two connections, so that shouldn't be--Then we've got one more connection coming off of it,which is this one.We've got one more connection on that.Then of course you'd have it on that one as well.In that case, you end up with a creature with two dangly legs coming off the side.Let's just see one more, which is the one with recursion.I'll try not to get in the way.If we draw a graph like this and this one's going to have--This is the example from the paper actually.This one has 1, 2, 3, 4 connections coming out to this oneand then it has one recurrent connection going back.That's the graph that Sims used as an example in the paper.Let's just iterate on that and turn it into a morphologyand see how it works.This one would turn into a creature with, so that would be the head connectedto a body.The body's got four connections that'll go 1, 2, 3, 4,and each of those has a box.Then because we've got this bit because the leg bit has also gota recurrent connection on it, it means it's got an additional linkon it.We've got jointed legs and arms, if you like.That's the example from the paper.Using both recursion and the multiple connections idea.That gives you this jointed two arms, two legs creature with a head and a body.That's essentially how the morphology is represented.The genotype is actually a graph structure,a directed graph with this recursion and multiple connections allowed.That's the morphology.Then what about the control system?In order to move these creatures, you need a control system.The control system maps from basically sensor inputson the left to motor or actuator outputs up there, right.We've got J1, J2 represent two joints.This is a thing with two joints and the joints are the thingsthat connect the two pieces together.The J1 J2, is saying, \"What angle is that joint at?\"Then A1, A2 are the actuators.They're sort of the motors which set the position.It's basically putting some power into that joint.Then in the middle, you've got this network,another directed graph, basically.Again, that's encoded genetically as well.In later example, so remember earlier I was sayingthat the fitness function there's different fitness functionsand what we mean here is that he also had different sensorscoming in.More on that in a minute again.This is how he did the simulation.\"In order to test these creatures I need to simulate,\"so he says, \"Dynamic simulation is used to calculatethe movement of creatures resulting from the interactionwith a virtual three-dimensional world.\"In the paper, he basically says he ran them in simulation.This is 1994, I think he had a population size of 300.If you think about it, how would you go aboutrunning 300 complicated physics simulationsmultiple times for all the generations?The answer is you'd get one of these, which is a connection machine, a CM-5,which is, I think one of the later models.It is basically a multiple processor, really powerful machine and in fact,the fastest computer in the world in 1993, apparently.He had access to one of these things, lucky Karl Sims.He was able to run his physics simulation fast enough in parallel on these machines,which had, I think had like 1024 SPARC CPUs,which are those kind of Sun Solaris operating systemran on it probably.Not sure, but you can look it up anyway.That is a pretty mean-looking machinewith that red light and a sort of precursorto the gaming rigs we have now, isn't it?Anyway, so that's the machine you ran it on in 1994,but we are going to be building our own version of thisthat will run on my little laptop here no problem.That's cool, isn't it?That we're now able to implement our own version of this and test it out.That's how we ran the simulation, but what's it actually doing?You got different fitness functions.In this work, virtual creatures are evolved by optimizingfor a specific task or behavior.He was interested in a few different tasks and behaviors.One of the ones was swimming underwater, trying to go towards a light,in which case they'd need to have an additional sensorbeyond the joint angle sensor to show them where the lightwas so some sort of light sensor.There was another one where they had to compete, actually,use competition as well.It's not in the original paper, but in the secondary paperthat came out later, he talked about competition as well.There's various fitness functions he used, but the most basic one,the one that we are going to implement is basically measuringhow far the thing can travel in a certain amount of time.How good at walking is it.To generate the next generation,the offspring are generated from the surviving creaturesby copying and combining their directed graph genotypes.When these graphs are reproduced, they're subjectedto probabilistic variation and mutation.Let's look at a few bits there.Copying and combining their directed graph genotypes.Basically, you get two parents and you mash their graphs together.That's one thing.Then you've got probabilistic variation or mutation.That's when you mash the graph together, then you maybe increase the amountof recursion on one or increase the number of connectionsbetween one another or add a whole new connection.There's various ways of mutating, those graphs that he used.The results.I just want to read this because I can't show youthe actual YouTube video on here, but you can go and look at it,but this gives you a flavor.This is a fitness function where he was measuringhow far they can walk.\"The walking fitness measure also produced a surprising numberof simple creatures that could shuffle or hobble along at fairly high speeds.Some walk with lizard-like gaits using the corners of their parts.Some simply wag an appendage in the air.\" they basically go like this.It allows them to move.It doesn't work for me, but it works for these creatures.\"They rock back and forth in just the right manner to forwards.\"You'll see all these wonderful movements in the YouTube videos and more.That's it.Again,like I said, at the time and even a few years afterwards,this was the classic example of a genetic algorithmbeing used to evolve forms.Maybe in later videos, we can come back or I'll give you some referencesfor state-of-the-art systems because, after this,a lot of work went on beyond Sims.People did all kinds of things and I'm going to give you some referencesfor those up to the present day.In summary, we've been talking about evolving morphologiesand we've looked at a specific example of one of the classic papers from 1994,which is Karl Sims' creatures paper.I talked about how he encoded the morphology as a directed graphand how that could be expressed into a phenotype.Then we talked about control and how there wasa neural network type of thing in there as well,which was also a directed graph.We talked about how he was able to run these things in simulation,using a super-powerful computer and the fitness function,which there were various fitness functions that he used,including seeing how far they could walk.We talked about mutation and how he generate the next generation.In this video, I've been talking about Karl Sims creatures."
