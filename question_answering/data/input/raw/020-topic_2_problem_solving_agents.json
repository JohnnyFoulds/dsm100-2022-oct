  "transcript": "[music]Previously, we assume that an agent is acting in a deterministicand observable environment.In this mini-lecture, we will consider non-deterministic,partially observable, or even unobservable environments.Just to remind you,if the next state of the environment is completely determinedby the current state and the action executed by the agent,then it is a deterministic environment,otherwise, it is non-deterministic or stochastic environment.If an agent's sensors give it access to the complete state of the environmentat any time point,then it is an observable environment.Otherwise, it is a partially observable or unobservable environment.For such environments, percepts are of particular use. Every percept gives additional information about the environmentand it helps to narrow down possibilities.If the environment is non-deterministic,percepts tell the agent which of the possible outcomes of actions has actually occurred.If the environment is partially observable,percepts narrow down the set of possible states.In any case, percepts cannot be determined in advance.Agents' future actions depend on future perceptsand the solution to a problem is no longer a sequence of actionsbut a contingency plan.What to do depending on what percepts are received.This is how humans act.The environment we live in is stochastic.We don't know the certainty,what is going to happen tomorrow or in a week.It is partially observable,there is a lot that we still don't know about our environment.We don't have a full map of the ocean floor.We don't fully understand how financial markets works.We don't know how many students we have for the next term,yet we can make short-term and long-term decisions.We are also good at it.This is intelligent behavior.In this mini-lecture, we will look at how artificial agents can actin such complex environment.First, we will consider non-deterministic searchand we need to change how a problem is defined.We need to generalize the notion of a transition model,a description of what each action doesbefore actions had unexpected effects.In a non-deterministic environment,a transition model has to define a set of possible outcomes for each action.We also need to generalize the notion of a solution.If before, it was a sequence of actions,now it is more of if-then-else statements.This can be represented as AND-OR search trees.We have already seen examples of search trees in the previous lectures.The branching was introduced by the agent's own choiceand that corresponds to OR nodes.In non-deterministic environments,environment also can introduce choicesand such choices correspond to AND nodes.Now what we'll consider, so erratic familiar example,it's a vacuum cleaner.We will introduce nondeterminism in the form of a powerfulbut erratic vacuum cleaner behavior.Now, the suck action works erratically, as follows.When applied to a dirty square, it cleans the square,but sometimes it also cleans the next square.When applied to a clean square, sometimes it deposits dirt.The transition model now contains a set of possible outcomes for the action suck.The figure on this slide shows an example AND-OR search tree,a fragment of it.For the erratic vacuum cleaner, the suck action is now non-deterministicwith two possible outcomes.It is depicted with OR nodewhereas the action is deterministic like move right,it is depicted with AND node.A solution for AND-OR search problem is a subtree set,has a Goal node at every leaf specifies one action at eachOR node and specifies every outcome branch at each AND node.Now we'll consider partially observable environments,an agent would know where it is, in what state it is.The key concept required for solvingpartially observable problems is the belief state.The agent's current belief about the possible physical state it might be in,given a sequence of actions and percepts up to that point.As a definition for problem of partially observable environmentshas to be generalized further.Initial state now can be any state.It is a set of all states.Actions depend on the state the agent is in.Suppose the agent is in the belief state B,this possible states S1 or S2,and the maybe actions for state S1 differ from actions of state S2.The actions for the belief state B can be defined,for example as union of all actions for state S,and all actions for state S2.Percepts, all observations are critical for solving partially observable problemsand it also considerably harder to define a transition model.Instead of defining the next step or the next state,there are now predicted.We will consider this on the classic example for a robotthat has to work out where it is,the localization problem or a maze problem.The robot in this maze-like environment has sensors that can detect obstaclesin all directions, north, south, west, and east.Obstacles like walls are depicted by dark yellow on this slide.The robot just has been switched on and it doesn't know where it is.It can be any state in any square in this figure.The robot receives a percept.Obstacles are at north and west.This narrows down the possibilities.There are only three states where obstacles are at north and west,then the robot moves.It still doesn't know exactly where it is.It can be in any adjacent squares to the previous identified three squares.It received new percept and percept tells that obstacle is at eastand there is only one location where it is possible.Is the problem solved?Of course, it is not obvious possible to find solutionin such complex environments.However, often it is possible.In this mini-lecture, we'll look at how intelligent agents can solve problems,find solutions in a more complex environments.When environment is non-deterministic and not observable.Stochastic and non-deterministic search algorithms are importantclass of algorithms with many real-world applications in robotics,diagnostics, and manufacturing."
