  "transcript": "In this mini-lecture,we will talk about history of automated scientific discovery.Many believe that it's not possible to automate scientific discovery.However, the history proves them wrong.We will see examples of fascinating, autonomous discoveries.A common view in the philosophy of science is that only humans can make discoveries,that the discovery is not logical,and therefore, can't be formalized and automated.\"The initial stage, the act of conceiving or inventing a theory seems to me neitherto call for logical analysis nor to be susceptible of it.My view may be expressed by saying that every discovery containsan irrational element or a creative intuition.\"Karl Popper, 1961.Yet, advances in AI proved it to be wrong.Dendral is a pioneering systemin the research area of automated scientific discovery.It was developed in the 1960s at Stanford Universityby Edward Feigenbaum, Bruce Buchanan, Joshua Lederberg, and Carl Djerassi.All are outstanding scientists.The primary aim was to studyhypothesis formation and discovery in science.The chosen task was to help organic chemistsin identifying unknown organic molecules by analyzing their mass spectraand using knowledge of chemistry.The motivation for the projectwas the exploration by robots of new planets.Such robots will need to take samples of organic matter,analyze them without directions from humans.The Dendral Project consists of research on two main programs,Heuristic Dendral and Meta-Dendral.Heuristic Dendral is a performance system and Meta-Dendral is a learning system.Many systems were derived from Dendral including MYCIN,for identification of bacteriacausing severe infections and for recommending suitable antibiotics.Another example is Bacon.It is an AI system that rediscovered numerical laws.It was developed by Langley, Simon, Bradshaw, and Zytkow in the '80s.Bacon carried out search through a problem space of algebraic termsto generate new terms from old ones.This led Bacon toward higher-level termsand a rediscovery of Kepler's third law of planetary motion.Bacon reconstructed a varietyof numeric relations from the history of physics and chemistry.There are many interesting discovery stories in AI research.To name a few, following Pat Langley,Reaction Pathways in Catalytic Chemistry by Valdez-Perez,Qualitative Chemical Factors in Mutagenesis by King and Srinivasan,Quantitative Laws of Metallic Behavior by Mitchell et al,Qualitative Conjecturesin Number Theory by Colton, Bundy, and Walsh,Temporal Laws of Ecological Behavior by Todorovski, Džeroski, and Kompare,Models of Gene-influenced Metabolism in Yeast by Kim et al.I have been working in this area for 20 years and I'm privilegedto personally know many of these brilliant scientists.Ashwin Snirivasan, Alan Bundy, Ljupco Todorovski, Sašo Džeroski.I've worked with Džeroski on the robot scientist project since 2004,and I would like to tell you more about the history of this fascinating project.The history of the robot scientist project dates more than two decades back.The first initial work started in 1999.The initial system had limited hardwareand could only rediscover original functional genomics knowledge.It was an important proof of concept work.In the next stage of the project,a robot scientist Adam has been constructed.It was a sophisticated automated lab system designed to discover new knowledge.The application domain was yeast functional genomics.Yeast is a simple model organismthat has being intensively studied by biologistsbecause it shares many gene functions with humans,and it is easier to experiment with yeast than with humans.In yeast, many functions of genes remain unknown.The task was to determine gene functions by growth experiments.The background knowledge,yeast metabolic model was encodedin logic, so Adam could process and reason over it.Adam also had access to bioinformatics databases.Hypothesis generation was done with the use of abductive reasoningand bioinformatics techniques.Experiments were designed to use active machine learningand we employed machine learning tools.Specifically Random Forest to analyze experimental resultsand make conclusionsif the generated hypothesis were confirmed or not.On this slide, you can see a diagram of Adam.It occupies the space of a small room.You can see Adam at work following the provided link as a YouTube video.Adam generated and confirmed the novel functional genomic hypotheses.Its conclusions have been also verified manually.Adam was the first machine to autonomously discovernovel scientific knowledge, hypothesize,and experimentally confirm it.Times Magazine named Adamas the fourth most significant scientific advance of 2009.The next robot scientist was named Eve.Eve worked on drug design for tropical diseases.Millions of people die of these diseasesand hundreds of millions of people suffer infection.It is really hard to cure these diseases,kill the parasites,yet they are neglected by the pharmaceutical industry.That is why robot scientists are of particular assistancein finding new drugs for tropical diseases.Background knowledge was encoded as graphs.Induction was used to generate novel hypothesis.Experiments were designed with the use of active learning and econometric model.One of the most interesting discoveriesby Eve was repositioning of triclosan for malaria.At a position, it means that the chemicalhas been already approved as a drug against a certain disease.Then it was shown that it is also active against a completely different disease.Triclosan is used in toothpaste, so it is known to be safe.It is a simple compound and easy to produce.What is most remarkable is that it is resistantto several variants of malaria.The next stage of the robot scientist project was AdaLab.It was a European project with several universitiesfrom France and Belgium.The application domain was systems biology.Even simple model biological systems like that of yeast are incredibly complicated.Thousands of genes, proteins,small molecules, are interacting together in complicated spatial-temporal ways.There are not enough specialists in the world to disentangle these systemsand such models are beyond human intuitive understanding.It is where robot scientists can help.The main focus of the AdaLab project was on closing the loop and repeatingthe cycles of scientific discovery on making the integrationof machine learning tools and robotic equipment seamless.The project also was looking athow human and robot scientists can collaborate on scientific tasks.AdaLab produced mainly machine learning tools and models.Please refer to our open access publicationsthat lists and describes them.AdaLab carried outthree closed-loop cycles of experimentation.As a result, substantial amount of knowledgehas been discovered and added in the form of an executable systems biology model.AdaLab results are of importance for cancer and aging research.However, the development of high fidelity systems biology modelsrequire hundreds maybe thousandsof closed-loop experimentations not just three.[?] of the next stage of the robot scientist projects, Genesis.Genesis has been designed and currently being assembledin the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.Genesis hardware will be ableto execute 10.000 closed-loop cycles of experimentation in parallel.This is equivalent to 1000 biologists working in one lab.Genesis AI will be able to automatically design, plan,and execute thousands of experimentsand improve a very complex systems biology model.There are other robot scientists in the world.For example, a mobile Robotic Chemist recently developed by Burger et al.in Liverpool is automating the research rather than the instruments.It can operate autonomously or for several days performinghundreds of experiments within a complex experimental space.You can watch it at work [?]  provided link to the YouTube video.Another example is the Automatic Statistician.This project aims to automate data science,producing predictionsand human readability reports from all datasets.There are more and moreautomated discovery systems are appearing in different domains.I would like to conclude this mini-lecture by telling you aboutthe Turing Nobel Prize challenge proposed by Professor Kitano from Japan.By 2050, develop AI systems that can makemajor scientific discoveries that worth Nobel Prize.Several of my collaborators and myselfwere at the meeting setting up the agenda for this challenge,and I hope to participate in the development of such an AI system.In this mini-lecture,we looked at the history of automated scientific discovery.The history dates back more than half a centurywith first systems developed in 1960s.Since then, a steady progress has been made.It is true that the discoveries are still on a rather modest scale,however, theory is flourishing.The target is to develop systemsthat are capable of significant scientific discoveries."
