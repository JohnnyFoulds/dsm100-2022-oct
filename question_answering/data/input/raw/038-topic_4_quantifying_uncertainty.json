  "transcript": "Decision CT dealswith choosing among actionsbased on desirability of their outcomes.In this mini-lecture, we will considernon-deterministic partially observable environments.In such an environment,an agent may not know the current state,but it still should know what actions are available.We will consider Results(a),where A is an action as a random variablewhose failures are the possible outcome states.The probability of outcome Sgiven evidence observations Ecan be expressed as a conditional probability.Probability of Result(a)=s'given a and ewhere the eon the right-hand side of the condition involvedstands for the eventthat the action a is executed.The agent's preferences are captured by the utility functions U,which assign a single number to express a disability of a state.The expected utility of an action,given the evidence,is just the average utility value of the outcomesweighted by the probability that the outcome occurs.The principle of Maximum Expected Utility, MEU,says that a rational agent should choose an actionthat maximizes the agent's expected utility.The MEU principle can be seen as defining all of AI.All intelligent agent has to dois to calculate various quantitiesto maximize the utility over its actions.It formalizes the notion that an agent should do the right things.However,it is difficult to quantify and estimate the utility values.Nevertheless,MEU enables a rational approach to designing AI systems.It can be difficult to define utility values.To start with,an agent should be able to express his preferenceslike A is better than Bor there is no difference in preferences between A and B.In this case,the space of preferences is an ordered space.Then, what does A and B can be?They can be many things.For example, it can be certain amount of money,but, often, they can be uncertain.For example,if an airplane passenger is offered the choice of meals,a chicken or pasta dish.There is a lot of uncertainty about such a choice.A pasta dish can be fantastic or overcooked.A chicken dish may be over spicy,and sooften making the choice is a lottery with possible outcomes.Then probabilities of those outcomes have to be specified.If a rational agent knowsall possible choices and all possible outcomesand has assigned to them probabilities,then it can compute and maximize expected utility.This is all rather complicatedand requires estimates of many probabilities.There also can be numerous constraintson the preferences that a rational agent should have.On the other hand,we humans do not compute multiple probabilities,but we are still able to make decisions.Can a rational agent imitate the decision process of a human?Humans not always act rationallyand their decision process can be affected by many factors.For example,the certainty effect.Let us go and see this Allais paradoxdesigned by Maurice Allais in 1950s.People are given the choice between lotteries A and Band then between C and D,which has the following prices.A, 80% chance of $4,000.B, 100% chance of $3,000.C, 20% chance of $4,000,and D, 25% chance of $3,000.Most people consistently prefer B over A,and D over C.To maximize the expected utility,the choice of A is better than Band D is better than C.Thus, there is no utility functionthat is consistent with the choices by humans.Thus,their choices appear to be irrational.However, people may take other considerations into account.They tend to choose a sure thing with 100% chance.This saves them calculationsand also reduces the emotional burden,a chance to be disappointed in their choiceafterwards.These effects are knownas the certainty effect and that regret effect.Another interesting observation is ambiguity aversion.In the Ellsberg paradox,the processes are fixedbut the probabilities are under constraint.The payoff depends  on the color of a ball chosen from an urn.The urn contains one-third of red ballsand two-thirds either black or yellow balls,but it is not known how many black or yellow balls.Again,people are given the choice between lotteries A and Band then between C and D.A, $100 for a red ball.B, $100 for a black ball.C, $100 for a red or yellow ball.D, $100 for a black or yellow ball.Most people prefer A over B and D over C.If one thinks there are more red balls than black ones,then the choice should be A and C.If one thinks there are less red balls than black ones,then the choice should be B and D.There is no rational strategy that favors A and D.This shows that most people make choose irrationally.They are avoidant in most ambiguous situations.They know one-third are red and two-thirds are black and yellow.That is what they choose.Thus, to imitate human decision can be difficult,but also it may be undesirable.Another difficulty is in assigning sensible values.For example, if they assign monetary values,they may not necessarily reflects rational strategy.Example,suppose you triumphedover the other competitors in television game show.The host now offers you a choice.Either you can take $1 million priceor you can gamble it on a flip of a coin.If the coin comes up heads, you end up with nothing,but if it comes up tails, you get 2.5 million.The expected utility value is $1.250 million,which is more than the originaland the rational choice would appear to be to gamble.However, it is generally agreed,unless you are a very rich person.The thrill added value of the second millionis considerably less than of the first millionfor the quality of your life and also for your financial status.Therefore,it is better not to risk one million.An example of another difficulty in assigning values to utilitiesis assigning value to human life.Many decisions include consideration of the value of human life,like a decision about what treatment to selector a decision about possibility of a car accident.However, there is no any agreed approach to making such valuations.Moreover, researchers all showthat such evaluation can be varied different from self-evaluations.One more considerationto take into account when designing a rational agentis that the expected utility functions tend to be over-optimistic.Mr. [?] said,\"The more choices are available,the more bias towards over-optimistic expectations.This then results in what is called post-decision disappointment.\"To appreciate the complexity of the decision-making process,it is also important to take into account that utility values can change over time.Such rational agents should make rational decisionsby maximizing the expected utility value at each step.However,in nondeterministic, partially observable environments,it is extremely hardto account for all possible outcomesand assign sensible probabilities and utility values to them.Decision Support Systems is a hot research area,and the steady progress has been made over recent years.A Decision Support System is an information system,or it can be subsystemsthat enhances the ability to make decisionsby a person, software agent, a robot, or a group of agents.An example Decision Support System is a system supporting diagnosis of patients.Decision Support System requires specification of a task.For example, diagnosis with an error rate below 5%.Objectives,for example, to minimize sufferingor maybe to maximize survival in five years.Constraints,for example,financial constraintsor have an explainable decisions.Decision Support System benefit from different approaches and techniques.Fuzzy logic has been studied since the 1920sand recently became popularfor modeling decision-making processesbased on imprecise non-numerical information.In Fuzzy logic, an element may belong to a set with a certain degree.Typically, represented as a real number from the interval 0,1.In non-fuzzy conventional logics like Boolean logic,there are no degrees, only true/false and 0/1.Therefore, fuzzy logic models can utilizedata and knowledge that lacks certainty.Case-based reasoningis based on exploiting old experiences to understand and solve new problems.A reasoner identifiesprevious situations that are similar to the current oneand reuses the original solutions to solve the new problem.It is much like what lawyers do.Case-based reasoning may adopt all solutionsto meet new demands or to explain or critique new situations.Qualitative reasoning or QRis using qualitative rather than quantitative information.Numerical values of quantities are avoidedand qualitative values are used instead.For example, add more water, reduce hit.QR is popular for human-like computing applicationsand it is motivated by human cognition.QR is used in such applicationas monitoring, diagnosis, explanation generation, and tutoring.One of the most popular techniques for Decision Support Systemis probabilistic reasoning.This is  what we are considering in this module.Probabilistic logic is employed for reasoning.It is particularly suitablefor reasoning under uncertainties and with partial beliefs.Probabilistic logic is suitable for both narrow and general AI.This isthe most popular and widely spread type of probabilistic reasoningis based on reasoning.In this mini-lecture, we discuss the difficultiesin making rational decisions under uncertainty.Rational agent has to accountfor all possible outcomes of all possible actions,while it is difficultto assign sensible utility values to all possible outcomes.Nevertheless, there is a steady progress in this area of decision-making.Nowadays, intelligent agents are capable of making better and better decisions.We talked about several popular techniques for Decision Support Systems,fuzzy logic,case-based reasoning,qualitative reasoning,and, of course, the most popular approach,probabilistic reasoning."
