  "transcript": "[music]Welcome to the evolving creatures case study.In this video, I'm just going to give you an introand tell you a bit of my inspiration for wanting to teach you all about this.Then I'm going to give you an overview of the things we're going to be looking atover the next five weeks of material.Yes, first of all, what are we doing here?We're learning about genetic algorithms.That's the headline.We're going to be building a genetic algorithmin this part of the material.We're going to be looking-- Genetic algorithmsare a branch of bio-inspired computing.Bio-inspired computing is a branch of artificial intelligence.This is really a key topic in artificial intelligence,the use of these evolutionary algorithms to design things and to solve problems.Specifically, we're going to be using genetic algorithms to design robotic formsre-implementing a famous research paper.Now, I wish I could show you a clip of the original videosof this 1994 research paper,but due to copyright reasons, I'm not able to.If you go on to YouTube,you can find Karl Sim's Creatures pretty easily.Suffice to say that this was a really seminal piece of work,where Karl Sims was able to actually use evolutionary computingand genetic algorithms to design morphologies of creaturesin a virtual world.Which you could then run and see moving around.The idea is they would evolve to be able to move around in the worldin different ways, and to follow lights and things like that.My personal interest in this field.Why am I interested in evolutionary computing?Why am I trying to tell you all about it?What's my path for getting in here?Yes, basically, I started out doing biological sciencesin my undergraduate studies.This is when I found out all about evolution theory,and also genetics, both of which I studied.Evolution theory was absolutely fascinatingfor me for something.There was something about the idea of these really complicated search spaces.The idea that nature was searching through these amazing abstract spacesfor solutions to problems.What's the best way to design a beak for a parrot?What's the best way to design a wing, and so on?All these things that nature was solving, using its own processeswere absolutely fascinating and also combined with genetics.The idea that there's a core substrate of all this stuff was the DNAand the fact that DNA was changing over time.Reading things like Dawkins' Selfish Gene theory,and beyond that, learning about how genes can regulate each other.Really, the genetic system of an organism being this amazing computational system,which is self-regulating and is able to control the organismover many years to achieve its goals.These two things were really inspirational at the undergraduate level.Following that, I actually went and studied evolutionary computationat master's level.I found out there was a degree course where I could combine my fascinationwith computers with also my new fascinationwith evolutionary theory and genetics,and I've not been doing much programming for many years.I had to get my C Programming book out and learn how to program in C and Java,and all the different languages back in the late 1990s.I was able to learn all about evolutionary computationand implement my own genetic algorithms.At the time, I was quite interested in music as well, still am.I was actually using these to solve problems which I was encounteringin my musical practice.The problem I was solving was how to designreally interesting sounds, because that's one of the key thingsfor a producer of music. How do you make a really good sound?I was using evolutionary computation to do that.Eventually, as you'll see here, I actually ended up studying thatfor my PhD.I actually did a PhD, where I was looking at using genetic algorithmsand other things like neural networks, and so on, to design sounds,to listen to sounds, and to understand how sounds are constructedusing different types of synthesizers.Okay, that's my personal interest in all of this.Now, what we're going to do now is just quickly go throughthe various things we're going to study, but before we do that,I'm going to show you this cool animation which is going to give yousome of the flavor of the things we're going to be buildingand seeing in the next few weeks.I've got it on my system over here.I just have to run this command here and then we will seethis really interesting system being built.What we're watching here is a bunch of random creaturesbeing designed by the machine and eventually dropped onto the floor.Not only that, we've got I think, 25 creatures in here,and these are just random ones.Now, if we zoom in a bit, we can see that actually,they're all moving.They all have motors in them and they're moving around.Then what we're going to be doing over the next few weeksis building a system which can basically designthese things for us, such that it finds the designswhich are the best of moving.It's going to look at all these designs and learn how to build themand to optimize them over time, so that you can find the onesthat are best at moving, which is very similar to what Karl Simswas doing in his original paper.We're going to follow along some of the techniqueshe was using in that paper.You can see they're all moving in interesting ways.How are we going to go about doing it?Well, here is the basic plan.We're going to have five weeks of material.This is organized into five chunks, if you like.The first chunk, week one is where we're going to find outabout the basics of bio-inspired computing.We're going to find out what it is, and where it fits into the fieldof artificial intelligence, and what their latest work isand what the history of it is a bit as well.Then we're going to have an evolution theory crash course,because I'm not going to assume that you know what evolution theory isor how it works.I'm going to give you a very focused description of it,which is applicable to what we're doing.Then we're going to have an introduction to evolving creatures.I'm going to talk about the Karl Sims paper,and how that works.Also, I'll talk about genetic algorithms, and why those work and give yousome of the insight into why they are powerful algorithms.Okay, that's the background that built the foundationsof what we're going to learn.In week two, we're going to be looking at actually building a system.We're going to start programming in week two.The videos are going to be showing you in great detail exactly how to buildall of these algorithms, and so on.We're going to be finding out the substrates of our evolution,which is these creatures encoded into URDF files.Now a URDF is an XML file format that's used in a lot of robotics work.Originally, it came from the ROS, Robot Operating System project,but it's now available in a range of robot simulation systems.It's becoming quite commonly used.There's lots of ready-made robot models that you can see,but we're going to be evolving new robot models in this format.We're going to be learning all about joints, links, and motors,which allow us to design these things and make them move.Okay, week two, we're going to get-- Sorry, week three,we're going to be getting into some more intense programming.There's going to be quite a lot of videos in this material,because I like to show you exactly how I'm going to programthis whole thing from scratch.I've built a complete reimplementation of most of the Karl Sims' work.You're going to seehow that is put together over these videos.We get really into it in week three, when we start buildingour genetic encoding, which takes a list of random numbersand basically turns it into one of these things, basically,a moving structured creature form.Okay, week four, we're going to be continuingwith our fairly intensive programming.We're going to build out the fitness function and population model,where the fitness function is actually used to evaluateall the creatures.Actually, here's a bit of a head- a clue here.The fitness function is really simple. It's just measuring how far they move.That's the most basic form, but you're going to be encouraged to goand investigate that more yourself.Yes, and the population model and how that's donein genetic algorithm research, we'll find out all about that.Eventually, at the end of week four, we're going to haveour complete genetic algorithm which will allow us to evolveand optimize those robot forms.Week five is where we're going to look at the state of the art, and the ethics,and other aspects of this evolving morphology research.We're going to find out what happened after the Sims.The Sims paper was '94.What did people do next?After this seminal work,what happened next? We'll find out.We'll follow people like Jeff Koons work, who now works at Uber, I believe.Yes, some really interesting workthat he did with soft robots and things like that.We'll be looking at some of that.We'll also be looking at the state of the art in other areasof evolving morphology.Not just moving creatures, but also evolvingneural network architectures.We'll be seeing that is something which is a very active area of research,where people are trying to create more optimized neural network designsthan humans can do themselves.You can see that's really cutting-edge work.Okay, that's the general plan.At the end, we'll have a fully functioning genetic algorithm,which can evolve creatures and which you can run machines.Throughout the course, as I say, you're going to be seeingloads of intense coding videos.If you find the coding videos are too long,because I deliberately made them long so you can see all the nasty details,but if you find it too long, it's okay.You can skip them or play them at a faster speed.You can basically jump ahead to the lab worksheetswhere I repeat the process.I lay it out in a text form, so you can copy-paste the codeinto your code editor and build up the thingthat you saw me building in the videos and have your own version of it.I'll also be supplying the source code for everything that you see,and you'll be able to modify that and do what you want with it.Okay, that's really all I wanted to say.I just say welcome to my creatures case study,exploration of evolutionary computing, which I think is a fascinating area.I hope you really enjoy building out this genetic algorithm system.I hope that you find some really cool creatureswhich move in very interesting ways, because it's a very creative typeof algorithm."
