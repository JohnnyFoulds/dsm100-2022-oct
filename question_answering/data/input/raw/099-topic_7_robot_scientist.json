  "transcript": "[music]In this mini-lecture, we will look at how data and knowledgeis encoded for real AI systems.I will briefly introduce you to several external dataand knowledge representations relevant to the idea of drug design.I will then explain how we use that external source of informationfor the robot scientist.We have developed a very simple toy domain model.Our toy data set has chemical entities,then chemicals with six properties.We also encoded some knowledge that there are drugs and toxins,and that small molecules are more likely to be biologically active.You may have guessed that real sources are far more complex than that.First, we will look at KB.On my screen you see ontologyof chemical entitiesof biological interest.If you look at summary, you can seethat it has well over 150.000 classesand it's also has different formats,including RDF.It all suitable for processingby our agents.We now will jump to classes.If you go classes and you can add for example,we will check what information it has about one of chemical compoundsthat is in our toy data set.I will type here morphineand so you just can follow,so I will read it, repeat it.Morphine has this ID 17303,and you see name morphine.You immediately can see useful information.It gives 12 synonyms and difference balance.For text mine application, this is extremely importantand for many, many applications.Because biochemical entities can have so many different names,these IDs, unique resource identifiers are critical to be surethat the different resources actually referring to the same entity.Then we have definition, what it is,it's more [?] alkaloids and so on.I'm not a chemist, it doesn't tell me much,but for chemists and also for systems that are reasoning over this knowledge,that is important.We also see all these properties, all these InChI,there is information molecular weights.All properties are here.Now we will look at database cross references.There are plenty of external resources, ontologies and databases.Here some of them are listed that also have these entry about morphine.We will go to drug bank.Here is ID.I already put it here.Let's go to set entity.Yes, it's here.What we see here,we see again brand names, generic name.We havemore background information.Drug bank is not an ontology, it is database,but it has a lot of useful information.You can see names in different languages.Mechanism explained, or usageor how it works, mechanism of action.There is even volume of distribution.Adverse effects, so toxicity and what pathways.Then you can see information on drug-drug interactions,with what other drugs it may interfere.Here you see more than 1,000 entries.There is also food interactions,like avoid alcohol.Plenty, plenty of useful informationthat can be used for various purposesand cogent reasoning.Now, we will use another cross reference.This set is the most relevant to usto case study of drug design is Campbell.Also it has morphine and Campbellit is created databasethat some humans really sit in and read in a lot of papersfrom this areas and say,extract information and they then sayput it into Campbell database.It also has data.If we look what is about the morphine,Campbell contains information aboutmore than two millions chemical compounds.About Morphine, yes, it is approvedafter maximum force stageof clinical trials.Again, synonyms, trade names, molecular type, small type.Yes, again, InChI, SMILES, alternative also you can seechemical structure.What is interesting here, what I would like to show you,you have these molecular features and you have here rule of fiveor so called the Lipinski rules.One of these rules is that, if a moleculeis a small molecules then it's more likelyto be drug, and other rules.Composition of these five rules, it makes a chemical compoundlikely to be a drug.It not necessarily makes it a drug and there are plenty of drugsthat breaks this rules, but it's still something useful to know.This encapsulates our knowledge about drug design.Here, it's immediately classified as small molecule.Campbell provides extremely valuable data on experiments with chemical compounds.We can see all these referencesto clinical trialsand you can access and see data.Quite a lot of them.In our project then, the robot scientist, we extensively use such resourcesso the robot produce its own drug design dataand plus it access the external data sources including,from Campbell.You can imagine that putting data and knowledgefrom these different resources, even if they provide this ID,so you can gather, that they are talking about the same entity,but still there is so much diverse informationand some information just textual.Putting it together, it's a difficult task.It's knowledge and data integration.We will not talk about it in this lecturebut it is an important stepfor any real AI system to gather this data and combine together,and altogether represent in machine-processable form.To show you how it may look like,I will show you our AdaLab ontologywhich is this AdaLab projectthat worked with system's biology.We mostly imported classes from other sources of information,mostly about systems' biology, about biological entities,but we put it all together, all entities that we need for the project,all information that we need for the project,what robot scientist needs to reason over, and it is in very strangeand logical format, so 460 classes.If you just can have a look.What we have here, so we use this upper-level ontology,it's called BFO Basic Formal Ontologybecause most of biological bio ontologistsare using it so it ensures interoperability.We can just have a look on some classes.Most of them, as I said, is imported.Yes, it takes time.Let's go to material entity,biochemical entity and interactions, so we worked only with some specific interactionsbetween biochemical entities and we all listed them here.Let's just see.You see that this is importedfrom INO ontology and because definition,so most of classes are like that.All classes that we need for reasoning about the output in unified structure.This is how real knowledge models look like.They are mostly externally available representations.Some have strict logic behind them, some are not.This is the challenge in task to put together all available informationand data set in logically consistent form,encoded in a forms that the AI systemcan reason with it.We looked at the drug bank, we looked at KB,and we looked on Campbell, we also looked at our own ontologythat the models entities for the AdaLab project."
