  "transcript": "[music]-In this video, I'm going to be talking about bio-inspired computing.In summary, we're going to start by giving you a brief definitionof bio-inspired computing.I'm probably going to be reflecting a little bit on some of my own experiencesin this area as we go.Then we're going to ask the question, is it artificial intelligence?Then we're going to look from a historical perspectiveat some of the key areas that have developedin relation to bio-inspired computing.Let's start off with our definition.This is my attempt to summing up what it's all about.What I've got here is looking at the algorithmsand functions in the natural worldand thinking there must be something we can use computationally here.Just reflecting on my own experience, I did a genetic zoology undergraduatedegree and it was all great.Dissecting things and drawing pictures of animals.Frankly, I didn't find it that interesting.Then I hit evolution theory and I hit geneticsand the DNA self-controlling system.My mind was blown. It was really brilliant.I was really hooked from that point on.For me as a person who started programming at a very young age, then stopped,and then got back into it later,evolution and genetics and biosystems were the bridge between the two areas,if you like.I found that looking at evolution theoryis this amazing system which could develop all these fascinating formsand had all these weird and strange characteristics inside it.Then again with genetics, it's like a crazy computer,your genome, right? It's like a self-modulating,self-replicating crazy machine.What inspires people when they're doing bio-inspired computingis they look at these amazing complex systemsand they think, \"Surely some of these algorithmscan be taken out and we can take the essence of them.We can use them to do computational thingssuch as optimization or automatic design and so on.Then we're going to look at a few thingswhich can be done with bio-inspired computing in a sec.The next question, is bio-inspired computing equivalentto AI? Is it AI?In this review paper, which is 30 pages long in the Swarmand Evolutionary Computation journal.I recommend reading this, but scanning through it,just to give you an insight of depth of the field and what's going on.It's from 2019 so it's fairly recent,but they gave a definition of bio-inspired computingor a description of it saying it's emerged as one of the most studied branchesof artificial intelligence during the last decades.Really if you haven't heard of it yet,this is key, really a large area of AI.If you trust the experts, then yes, it's AI.What we're going to do now is do a brief historical viewof various bio-inspired technologies and systems that were developedover the years.They don't sit neatly into each decade.They all spread through and mix with each other,but I just want to mention some of themand say what they're about because it shows how it gradually grewas a research field, I suppose.In the 1950s up there, you can see we've got cybernetics.Then we moved into connectionism and then we've got genetic algorithms,artificial life, and then onwards and upwards after that.Let's go through those and look at them in a bit more detail.First of all, cybernetics.Cybernetics is a word which was first coinedfor this area by Norbert Wiener.He wrote a book in 1948 called cybernetics.The word comes from the Greek wordfor steersman the person that steers the boat.Let's just read that out.It says, \"The science of control and communicationin the animal and the machine.\" That's what cybernetics is.It's about control and communication.Interestingly, it's not so much about form.It's not really about studying what's out there in nature,what it looks like, what color it is, how many legs it's got.It's much more about how it works, how it functions, how it controls itself,and how the different entities might communicatewith each other or different bits of an entitymight effectively communicate with each other.Then I also wanted to mention Ross Ashby.I've got his book Introduction to Cybernetics up on the shelf there.It's got a really cool font but I can't show you itfor copyright reasons. Sorry, but go and look it up,Introduction to Cybernetics by Ashby and you'll see it.Basically, he focuses a bit more, again, he was a contemporary of Wiener.Wiener was based at MIT, Ashby as a British computer scientistor electromechanical engineering person, I would say, and a mathematician.Drilling down a bit more, so coordination, regulation, and control.Building on that science of control and communication.It's all about not about the form of things, but the way that they interact.Just worth saying, this is an interesting essay,which you can go and dig out online about the British cyberneticiansand what they're up to.Ashby, Beer and Pask, really interesting stuff.What was particularly interesting about cybernetics maybe is the factthat it was very cross-disciplinary.It turned into something that was quite cross-disciplinarybecause people started applying the conceptsto all kinds of things like buildings to corporations and so on.Can you look at how some sort of natural system workslike an ant colony or something, can you apply some of those conceptsof communication coordination to a corporationand make that work more efficiently, for example?It's worth having a read of that to see the wider range of cybernetics.Connectionism, this is the big one.[chuckles] This is neural networks.I've got a quote here from Rosenblatt who's credited with having come upwith the perceptron or invented the perceptronand the perceptron was exactly a minimally constrained nerve net.Nerve net, not a neural net, but a nerve net consistingof logically simplified neural elements,which has been shown to be capable of learning,to discriminate and to recognize perceptual patterns.Rosenblatt in 1960 there.This is connectionism, this is the birth of neural networks,which obviously led to deep neural networks,which is what everyone is crazy about now.There's no doubt that neural networks are bio-inspired, they're basicallylooking at the nervous systems and the brains of animalsand people and thinking, \"Mmh,that seems to be doing something pretty interesting and useful.Maybe we can simplify it, extract the essence,which is this idea of a network of things which are connected together,and let signals flow through with different activation patterns.Then maybe it can learn to do things too, and indeed it can.\"Moving on.Whoops. Artificial life.Artificial life, before we talk about the more '80sand '90s artificial life, I just wanted to mention Barricelli's workwho is working on simulating dynamic systemson IBM valve computers.I cannot imagine how he did this in the 1950s,working on punch cards or whatever, to program these systems,to run these really computationally expensive simulations.There must have been some amazing programming going on there.That's all I'm going to say.That's worth reading about as well.Another interesting, if you're interested in where this stuffcomes from and the history of it, that's definitely worth reading about.Jumping forward into the '80s and '90s.Chris Langton in the late '80s set up the artificial life conferenceand this field grew out from there.It really bloomed and lots of people were looking at this stuff.The take-home is this quote, which I really like,which is \"life as it could be\" it's life as it could be.It's not about simulating life as realistically as possible so much.It's more about thinking about, \"Okay,if we've got some basic evolution, a system that's got some basic evolutionlike behavior, and we can have entities in there growingand whatever it's artificial, what kind of things can we grow?What kind of life is possible in a simulation?\"It's really fascinating.A lot of the early work was looking, and to this day, in fact,doing things like trying to create a simple version of the primordial soupwhere RNA evolved or emerged from these massive chemicalson the earth and all that.It's looking at early origins of life and simulating that,but also looking at other new types of life, artificial life that runson silicon and how that could work.That's really an interesting field connectedwith complexity theory and chaos theory as well.What about genetic algorithms?Well, we're going to be looking at loads of stuff about genetic algorithmsin the next few videos. I won't go into much detail,but essentially genetic algorithms are somethingwhich allows you to evolve solutions to problemsinside a computer in essence.It's all about defining your problem in a way that the algorithm can useand then defining a correct way to evaluate different versionsand iterate on those solutions to make them betterand better over time.That's what we'll see in the next few videos.In summary, what we've just been talking about is bio-inspired computing.I've given you a definition.We've considered whether it's artificial intelligence or not.Then we've looked at some examples of bio-inspired computing going rightthe way back to the '50s and cyberneticsand moving through connectionism and neural networksand artificial life and genetic algorithms.This video was all about bio-inspired computing."
