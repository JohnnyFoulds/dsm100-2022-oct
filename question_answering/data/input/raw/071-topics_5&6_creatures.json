  "transcript": "[music]Welcome to Week 4. That's great.You made it through Week 3 and you came back for more.We're going to be doing some more intensive coding this weekbecause this is actually the last weekwe're going to be spending doing a lot of development work.At the end of this week,we're going to have a completely functioning genetic algorithmwhich allows us to evolve creaturesto this problem of moving around in the world.The learning objectives are listed here.We are going to be able to explainhow fitness functions and population modelsare used in genetic algorithms to optimize a set of solutions.That means we're going to be learningabout what the purpose of a fitness function is,what the purpose of a population model is.Secondly,we're going to be implementing a fitness function and a population model,then we're going to be using it to evaluate the creaturesand to maintain a population of creatures that evolve over time.Finally, we're going to be using genetic manipulation techniquesto create variation and cross-breeding within a population.That's how we get accessto the special sauce of a genetic algorithmwhich allows it to do this multiplanar sampling or searchingwhere it's sampling and searching in different placesin the solution space as it were.Welcometo the beginning of the final intensive weekof programming for the creatures case study, which is Week 4.There's Week 5 as wellwhere are we going to be looking at some papers,but for this week, it's more programming.Good luck.Remember that if you find the videos are a bit too long and intense, that's okay.I'll give you further instructions in the lab worksheetsand also give you the codeso that you can fully recreate what I'm doing in the videosby just working through a worksheet if you prefer to work that way."
