  "transcript": "[music]Welcome to week three of the creatures case study.If you've got this far, you're doing really well,you've got your PI bullet system up and running,and you've been able to create some creatures in the world.What we're going to do this week is really go to the next level,and allow ourselves to create creaturesin a highly programmatic parameterized way.What are we going to achieve this week?Firstly, we're going to be able to explain how solutions to a problemcan be represented using a genetic encoding scheme.Well, and that sounds a bit interesting so what is the problem?Well, the problem is,we want to know what kind of three-dimensional structure we need to design a robot, and we want to also have motor controls for that robot so that it movesin a useful way such that it can get as far as possible from the starting point, that's our problem. We're going to have to figure out how to encode solutions to that problemin a way that's amenable to the evolutionary process.That's the first thing we're going to achieve.As I said, we're going to implement a genetic algorithm, a genetic encoding scheme, in order to do thatso we'll understand the basics of how to encode things genetically,and we're actually going to line-by-line implement a genetic encoding schemeto describe these 3D robots in a way that can be evolved.Thirdly, once we've developed our own genetic and coding schemeand seeing how it's built from scratch, when we come later in this case study to look at some state of the art systems,we're going to have a really much stronger insightinto how those systems work and how the encoding schemes work,because we've built one ourselves from scratch, so we know exactly the details.I've got a little screenshot for you here,so this is just a little taster of something we're going to be seeing this week.Previously, we've seen these ready-made and simplistic robots embedded in 3D environments.You can see this is clearly more complicated,and actually, it's moving as well,but I'm going to hold that one back as a cliffhanger,you're going to get to see these random, interesting shapes, actually moving around robotically in the world at the end of this week.Welcome to week three. Good luck.There's a lot of video content this week,so you're going to have to focus to get through it, but feel free to set it on 1.5 speed, speed it up if you need to,to get through those videos quicker because I do cover all the steps again,in the lab worksheet so you won't miss anything if you skipped on the videos if you find it's a bit too much,so that's fine. Just go to the lab worksheets,but I hope you do watch the videos because there's lots of insightsand little details in there that I put in as I work through the code."
