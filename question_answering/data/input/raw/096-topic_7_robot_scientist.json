  "transcript": "[music]In this mini-lecture, we will look at a toy knowledge base and a toy datasetfor our toy robot scientist.I will briefly introduce you to the domain of drug discovery.We will discuss the ways of representing domain knowledgeand the advantages and disadvantages.Our toy robot scientist is designed to assist in drug discovery.The drug discovery is a long process.It usually takes on average 10 years to deliver a new drug to a market,and it can cost billions.It usually starts from a library screening.A library is a collection of chemical compounds.Pharmaceutical companies can have millions of chemical compoundsin their storage rooms.Screening is running experiments or assayswith chemical compounds in a lab.Chemicals are added to biological culture to see if there are any signsof biological activity.If [?] a chemical has a desirable effect.This is how drugs are working in our body.They are affecting our biological processes.The select compounds for screening and to prepare biological samplesare challenging tasks.If experiments show that the compound is biologically active,then it is investigated further.Such compounds are called hits.The next step is a hit confirmation.It can be for example, [?] identified hits at different concentration levels.Confirmed hits are called leads, and they have a chanceto be an approved drug.Of course, many more stages are required for that, including clinical trials.Our toy robot scientist is focusing on identifying leads.If the initial stages of drug design from a compound to a leadcan be automated, then that would speed up the whole drug discovery process.It will save money, and ultimately, it will save lives by bringing drugsto the market earlier.How can the data knowledge about chemical compounds be represented?Each compound is a molecule.If you remember chemistry, then you know that the structureof a molecule is formed by atoms and chemical bonds between them.On this slide, you see an example of molecular structure.This chemical compound is Aceclidine.It is a drug that is used as eye drops to treat glaucoma.A molecular structure can be represented in many ways.For example, as an image,a molecular formula, InChi string,InChi key, Canonical SMILES, et cetera.I will not explain what InChi and SMILES mean,but they're commonly used at representations.The most common representation is a table because it is amenableto machine learning, even if it is not the most nativeor elegant representation of a molecule structure.On this slide, you see a toy dataset in the form of a table.Compounds are represented.They are properties of molecules and molecular structure,including molecular weight.It is measured in daltons.Hydrophobicity is the physical propertyof a molecule related to water solubility.Hydrophobic compounds do not dissolve well in water, like oils or fats.Hydrogen donor is a compound that gives up or transfers a hydrogen atomto another substance.Hydrogen acceptor is a compound that accepts a hydrogen atomfrom another substance.Heavy atoms refer to any atoms that is not hydrogen.A compound has a ring if its atoms are in a ring or cyclic configuration.We want to go beyond the table representationto include the full power of logic, especially inductive reasoning.To enable that, we need to represent domain knowledge and data in logic.First, we will design a conceptual model of our domain.What we know is there are chemical compoundsand they have several properties.This is represented in the diagram in blue.This is what we know from the table.However, we also know more about drug design.We know that there are already approved drugsand there are toxins, and toxins can't be drugs.Well, because they are toxic.We also know a little bit about our biology.For example, small molecules with a low molecular weightare more likely to have an effect when administered to our body.Large molecules are unlikely to go through our cell membranes.Such knowledge is not in the table.If there is enough suitable data, then machine learning can discoverthis knowledge, but we don't need machine learningfor that.It is common domain knowledge that this would make sense.Anyway, common ground knowledge or results of machine learning,we want to add it to our knowledge model.This highlights one of the principal limitationsof conventional machine learning.It may be tricky to add new information to improve the learningunless it is in the same form and as the remaining information.In our case, we can easily add more lines to the table.Adding information is trickier.We can add columns with the classification drug, toxin,unknown and small, medium, large molecule.Then it's still not immediately clear that the small molecule has a high chanceto be a drug than a large molecule.Our toy knowledge domain is tiny,and perhaps we can express most of itin the form of a table or as a suitable for machine learning representation.Imagine a real complex domain with many hierarchical layers,complex connections, assumptions, and restrictions.Most of such knowledge will be missed by conventionalmachine learning approaches.We can represent our domain knowledge in several ways usingthe skillset of this module.Encode it in Python.This is tricky.Python is not designed for knowledge representation,but that is possible, and I will show you how to do that.Encode in RDF and export it to Python.This is better because RDF will dictate a good structurefor our data and knowledge.Or we can use a dedicated tool, Protégé to encode it in RDF,and then export to Python.This is good because Protégé has inbuilt reasoners that can checkour representation for logical consistency.Moreover, a reasoned can infer missing facts.We also can encode it in First Order Logic in Prologand use Prolog Inference Engine.This is also good but it does require knowing Prolog.Prolog also can take an RDF representation as an input.In this mini-lecture, we talked about the toy domain knowledgefor the toy robot scientist.Our toy domain is simple and can be represented as a tableor in a more amenable for reason and form.More complex domain knowledge is harder to represent as a tableor even as a database.Logic is more suitable for capturingour knowledge and reasoning [?]."
