  "transcript": "[music]Welcome to week three of the game-playing AI case study.This week, we're finally going to dig into some code and start buildingsome AI systems which can play games, well, simplistic ones anywayto start off withbecause really the focus this week is tooling.We're going to learn about the basic toolingthat we're going to be using to build this DQN agent.Here's the learning objective.First of all, we're going to be using the open AI gym library to implementa game simulation environment.We're going to learn all about how we can createa correct environment with which our agent can interactin simulation, and secondly, we're going to developa simple random game-playing agent that can operate in an AI gym.We're going to create if you like the most simple possible agentthat does something in the world and learn how to do that.That will show us the whole thing, the whole process of building an agent.Finally, we're going to learn a little bit about the Keras library.I'll just say that it's a whole course to develop,to learn all about neural networks and Keras.I'm just going to give you some highlights just to give you just about enoughif you haven't done any neural networks before,just about enough to grasp what's going on in the neural networkin the DQN agent and how that's done with the Keras library,especially focusingon the convolutional aspect of the neural network.We're going to talk a lot about convolution in this week.Let's just have some highlights of things we're going to see.Here we go. We're going to be seeing some--these are some of the open AI gym environments.You can see we've got these kinds of examples like Box2Dsimulated physics-type environments, we've got our custom one over herewhich we've built for you because we can't show you the Atari onesfor copyright reasons but we've done our own version of the Atari game.Then there's another one up there which is the Lunar Lander example.Here's the exciting thing.Personally, I think it's the most exciting thingthat you'll see this week.You are going to see what a neural network seeswhen it looks at the game.We are going to show you what a convolutional neural networkactually sees when it looks at a video game.What you can see here is is the output of 32 filters which the neural networkhas learned how to configure such that it can pull outthe relevant information that it needs from the view coming in from the game.You're going to find out all about how that worksand what that means this week.Welcome to week three.We're going to roll the sleeves up and learn all about the toolsof open AI gym and neural networks this week."
