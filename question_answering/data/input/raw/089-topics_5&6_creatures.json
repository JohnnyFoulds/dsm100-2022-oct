  "transcript": "[music]-That's it. You've reached the end of the AI creatures case study.What I'm going to do in this video is I'm just going to reviewsome of the things we've been working through and give a few reflectionson what we were doing as we went through.What I'll say, at this point, is I really hopethat you enjoyed watching me programand then following along in the lab worksheetsand programming your own version of this genetic algorithm.I really hope that you're inspired to go off and try and adapt it,improve the fitness function, work on the morphology and coding,and all the kinds of things because I think it's really inspiring areato investigate and work in.You could end up tweaking this thing for weeks and weeksand really get some interesting results.I hope you're able to share some of your interesting creaturesin the forums with other students so that people could see.If you think about it, what we created here, each of you evolving,doing your evolutionary run, was like a separate niche and ecosystem.Then, we're sharing the creatures over multiple populationsacross multiple machines.Really, what we've done is created a distributed genetic algorithm,but that only works if we're sharing CSV files with each other.Let's go back down to earth and see what we've been doing in the last few weeks.First of all, just to remind ourselves,we've been learning about genetic algorithms.Genetic algorithms are a branch of, what's generally known now,as bio-inspired computing.It used to be evolutionary computing.That is a branch of artificial intelligence.It's a very powerful set of algorithms you've seenthat can really figure out how to solve problems really from scratchwithout needing to have a massive data set to begin with.That's what's interesting about this type of algorithms to me.We've been actually using genetic algorithms to solve the problemof how to make walking robots.We've been reimplementing a famous research paper from the '90s,which, if you ever study bio-inspired computing,typically that video, you'll get shown that pretty early in the course.This is amazing.What's great about this course is we've just implementedthe whole thing ourselves from scratch,which is probably not so common in those other courses.What did we do?Week 1. We were learning about bio-inspired computing,we had an evolution theory crash course,and we had an introduction to the original research paper and how it works.You might remember my slightly iffy pie chartshowing how roulette wheel selection works.Week 2, we were looking at beginning our coding process.In particular, we were looking at the URDF file format.URDF is really an interesting file format to know about because,if you go and look at other robot simulation environmentslike MuJoCo and Gazebo and ROS, of course,you'll see that that file format is supported in many different environments.Once you know what it's about, it's really transferableand useful skill to know.It's been worthwhile learning in detail how that works.Of course, we've been abusing it terriblyby automatically generating URDF files, but that's the way it is.You might remember this image of this poor robot stuck in the floorbecause we weren't running the simulationand in the middle of an interesting temple there.Week 3, we started getting more into the coding.It was a pretty intensive coding week there.We were working on the genetic encoding,which allows us to get a list of random numbersand basically turn them into a moving,real robot or simulated robot in our 3D environment.You may remember we started seeing things a bit like this at the end of Week 3.Week 4, we continued with the intensive codingand worked on the fitness function and the population models.We actually completed the genetic algorithm.Hopefully, in Week 4 is when you were seeingyou were able to do some evolutionary runs,and you were sharing with other people on the forumsand seeing weird and wonderful creatures coming out of the systemand lots of cheaters, no doubt, as well.You remember I showed you this spinning flying robot.That was my favorite cheater,the kind of thing that invented being a helicopter, basically.You may or may not have seen something as complicated as thisdepending if your fitness function actually selectedfor huge complexity or not.Week 5 was when we'd completed the GA,but we looked at some of the State of the Art papers,just tracking what happened with this research threadgoing from when Sims wrote his original paper in '94 through to,more or less, present-day.Looking at some of the latest articleswhere people are actually evolving soft robots using soft-body physics,and also even creating these things in the real world.Actually, being able to, once you've evolved something,then create it, 3D print it or something like that,into the real world and see how it actually works.That was pretty interesting.We also looked at some of the neural networks,how people are evolving deep neural networks.Actually, some of them are competitive with human-designed deep neural networks.This is definitely a hot area of neural networks research at the moment,bringing evolutionary or bio-inspired computing back into the mainstream again.That is, more or less, it.I'm just going to wrap up here and say,thanks a lot for following along for the course to the end here.Well done. You've done a lot of thinking, a lot of learning,and I hope that it was interesting and worthwhile for you to do that.I've really enjoyed developing all of this content.I hope that enthusiasm comes acrossand that you've now got an interesting evolutionary computation systemrunning on your machine.Great. Hope to see you again in some of our other content."
