  "transcript": "-In this demo video, I will show youhow our planning agent works.A plotting agent takes input a list of hypotheses,and it needs to output an experimental protocol to test them.To initiate the planning agent, you need to press three in the main file.Let's do that, three.First what it does it checks the hypothesis to test.We have a separate agent, reasoning agent,that can generate this hypothesis.If planning agent was called before that, maybe you pressthree first thing not one, not two then file this hypothesiswould be empty and this wouldn't be hypotheses to test then it willinform that there are no hypotheses to test.Keeping hypotheses in a separate file it's goodbecause they don't need to be generated may be somehuman scientists just don't have hypotheses to test and it can sendthese hypotheses to robot scientists through this agentto generate the protocols.Hypotheses can be read.It's important to have it so this is an input so there are hypotheses to test.Wonderful.Let's look inside.This is planning agent script the what we see insideso again important posts for working with files, and thenit imparts several custom modules.It needs not only hypotheses, this agent needs quite a lot of knowledge.It needs to know equipment, what equipment isavailable in any particular laboratory, and what this equipment can do.Different labs will have different equipment with different functionality.It's important to specify.Let's have a look what is in our list of equipment.We have here equipment and we have only a few piecesin this case, we have plate that has functions talk and then whatit can store some cell culture.This is just a template the form description of equipmentso what it is function and to what so with his workings object,then we have an incubator that can grow.And with it's working with some plate growth some cell cultureis on this plate, then we have a reed withfunctionality to measure potency.Potency is drug activity.Drug activity can be measured by you various measuresand potency indicates how activities and in our case,we will measure it by some real number from zero to one.The closer to one, the more active the more potent the chemicalis closer to zero less potent, and so it can measure potencythen and it can take plates, books with the plateand also have trashed it can discharge this plates.This is the list of our equipment what it can do and with what.As then we also have materials, let's have a look, materials.Any lab has a description of what is available.So here is just the list of all chemicals.Whatever requires for experiments, again, depends on lab,depends on a day something can be available somethingmight have been available.If it's not available, then it's possible to purchase or maybe it's not possible.Something is easy to buy something is not some chemicals are expensive.Difference in price can be 100 times between different chemicals.Any lab will have this accountancy what is availableand what quantity, how much it cost.If something needs to be ordered or orders that areawaiting sets, what is shipped.It's quite complicated accountancy usually for each series labs.In our case, we have only chemicals, some cell culture not worried about costs.Let's go back to our planning agents.It takes a description of this equipment, materials,and also experimental protocols.Output will be experimental protocol but what it takes us inputit's some generic protocol, some standard, each lab isdesigned around that usually several standard protocols.Protocols it then can be modified, substantially modified,but there are some basic steps.It's not done from scratch.I've never seen it.In theory, it's possible, but it's just not how it's done.We can have a look at the experimental protocol so yes.With this here, it's actually a script for generation of protocol.It is based on some standard protocol set has key steps.Steps are defined like name or step, and then bothequipment and would heat.Let's have a look.First, they needs to know iterations.Usually, everything is repeated like we have a read, we have an incubator.So regions measurements usually are taken several times,we just specify how many times.You grow for 20 minutes and every 20 minutes you makemeasurements of what is happening and put it back to grow.You need to specify.Since you have these typical actions like add what to add towhat so you can add chemical to play the move, you can play itmove play to an incubator, then you grow and play it for 20 minutes.It's like recommended duration.It's in this standard protocol, but it can be more definedit can be more frequent or less frequent move to reader.This is like cycle every 20 minutes, grow in incubator move to reader,measure potency, and move back to incubator advisor and discharge.It's stanard protocols that reflects current knowledge aboutgood experimental practices.What this particular lab can do.Also, in the beginning, there is add control drug.If you remember, our hypothesis generation agentformulated for hypothesis for chemicals were identifiedas potential drugs to test.This agent is about to design protocol.More specifically it will be instantiated this generic protocolto test this hypothesis but what it also does, it adds control.In this case, it adds morphine.We know that it is a drug.It is in our knowledge base that it is a drug.We added it's called positive control.Just to be sure that our measurements indeed shows that it is a drugthen we will have more confidence than other measurements willshow that another chemical is a drug but have more confidencethat measurements are accurate that we can trust it.It's also good practice to add some negative controls thatwe know for sure is not good.Those are toxins, we know for sure it's not goodbut we are not doing it here.This is our standard protocol.Go back to planning.This is what planning agent needs to know.It needs hypothesis.It needs description of equipment.It needs description or materials available materials.It also needs some knowledge about planning of experimentslike agent controls, or what are standard protocols?What are possible?A lot of kinds of knowledge.The reality is that this experimental practice,experimental knowledge is not well-documented.There are protocols, but also knowledge, it's usually in a few months,heads passed from professor to students or not passed the tools,many errors are repeated again and again,but it's a good when it is recorded.It's good when it is represented in knowledge-based,and then it can be used for generating better protocols.It input all this information, define some parts that we need,like where this hypothesis.Yes, it's first checks if there are hypotheses on some.If there are hypotheses, it start learning.First of all, it retrieves hypotheses and brings them.This is what we see, and then press something to go to the next step.Oh, what is happening on the next step?It translates, given hypothesis is to testable hypotheses.Let's press and see what happened.Our hypothesis is likely drug [?]Whether with [?] it is a chemical that is in Tumeric.This is what is used in Indian cooking that gives this bright yellow color.There are indications that it is active.We run experiments with that and there are indicationsthat it can be used for cancer treatment.In this knowledge, one that we don't know it, so we wouldlike to check it, but we don't have any equipment that can measure,\"It's likely drug or not?\" Without equipment it can measure potency.There should be a rule in a knowledge base that the thislikely drug can be replaced to measure potency.If potency is high then it is equivalent to likely being a drug.This planning agent replaces hypothesis, generated by hypothesis generation agent,by testable hypothesis, but hypothesis is that it'spossible to test in this particular lab.This is a difficult step, and in the reality, these hypothesesare usually given in this form, and it's also how humans operate.They may check something.They would like to test some hypothesis, but then they are bound by the reality.What is possible to test and not every hypothesis can be tested.Equipment is limited, so a lot of processes are used and thenbacktrack inferences done about what the initial question was.Shortcut will be to give hypothesis immediately in testable format.In these cases, planning agent just can't checkfunctionality of the equipment.Also yes, measure potent so it can be replaced.The likely drug by measure potency chemical,and if this potency high, then yes, there should be [?]Yes, now it has this testable hypothesis, then it will attempt to test sti0ll.It's quite important to check.What it does, it checks that material is available.It checks if equipment that measure potency exists,so yes and it checks if there is everything in store.If all chemicals are available if they are in the list of material.It's easy checks but they are important.The next step it causes some standard protocol.This is how this protocol looks like, so move plate to incubate.Bottom line is missing.First add chemicals to plate, and so in the [?] standard,the protocol generations that we have four hypotheses,four chemicals and it's adding one extra chemical as positive control.It adds more so we have five chemicals here.By the work can show you example, how these chemicalscan be distributed on a plate.It's just an example.Here very simple plate.It has four rows and six columns.In reality, plates can be 96 well plates, so each cell it's a well.Different chemicals, different gross media can be there.Each well can be like a different experiment.It can be 3, 8, 4, well plates or even more.Then ultrasound is used to transfer chemicals to thatsuper small well, so it is all very advanced.In our case, it's a vey simple plate.This is chemical.It's quite important to distribute them on a plate quite evenlybecause even on the small plates, there can be side effects.It's in an incubator, it's growing.On age, it will be more exposed to air.It can grow differently from being inside.It's also important to have this control.We have a line where there is just nothing, and here nothingand take measurements there.This is negative control, and we have positive control havingmore films that you know for sure it's [?]Then each chemical is placed several times.It's placed three times at each measurement.It will be measured several times, but it's also three times on a plate,and distributed randomly, or some more regular design likeLatin square design, but it's such small plate it's difficult to do.This is just how it looks like.Let's go.All right, so it adds chemicals to our plate,in the way how I've showed you.It follows this plate design, what to put where?Then move plate to incubator, to grow.Repeat how many times?Then, grow for 20 minutes.Move to reader.Measure potency, so take measurements, and go back.It loops several times, and then discharge the plate.It takes this protocol and so it's instance sheets.Instance sheets protocol it just adds these concrete chemicals,and non both loops.It's all quite easy, but it's easy only if enough knowledge is given.If there is this genetic protocol.If this hypothesis are specified, if hypotheses are testable,if equipment is described.Then as this is a toy example, but it's not very far from the reality.The reality, of course it's just more complex.There are many licenses that protocols many iterations,culture will be growing like for a day, or maybe several days.Technologically it's very similar.A standard protocol is taken and refined.Again, if something doesn't work, then some alterationto this protocol can be done.Maybe it will grow for longer.Maybe temperature will be higher, till good combinations are found,but this is how its pretty much is done in the reality.We looked at the toy planning agent, this agent can take inputthe hypothesis, it also needs to know about the lab,what the equipment is, what it can do, what materials are available,and also what experimental protocols.Standard protocols H-lab usually designed to run certain protocolsand some good experimental practices like agent positive-negative controls.It takes hypothesis mainly on outputs and experimental protocols.executed in real laboratory.Experimental protocol that then can be"
