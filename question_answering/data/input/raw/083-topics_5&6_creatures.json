  "transcript": "[music]In this video, we're going to look at some example creatures,which I've been able to evolve using the genetic algorithm.In summary, first of all, we're going to look at a kind of walker-type creature.Well, you can make your own verb up for what it's actually doing,but we'll look at that in a minute and that's a slow-moving one,but it moves in a slow and steady way.Then we're going to talk a little bit about the camera and how we can usethe camera better to follow the creatures around.Then we're going to look at runner and we're going to thinkabout whether we think that is a kind of cheating or not.First of all, the walker.Let me just play this one for you.What I've been doing is I've done a few runs and I've storedall the CSV files for the runs.This is my walker, which I've called it.If I just play that one, we can look at how effective it isand you can see it's definitely moving in a straight lineand it walks off the screen like that.That's exactly the kind of thing we want to be seeingwhen we're evolving these things.It's going to look similar to the Karl Sims onesif you dug them off of YouTube and that's pretty cool.Let me just show you this code for the camera now.The problem is as it walks off the screen, he can't see what it's doing anymore,and without having that much control over the camera, it's difficult to zoom inand see exactly how it's achieved its walking behavior.These lines here allow me to fix that.The first line is if we've seen before, it just gets the current positionof the creature.The second line below is essentially changingwhere the camera is, first of all, and where the camera is pointing.Where the camera is essentially it's set at a distancefrom the creature.Let me just take you through the arguments actually.I'll put those lines back in.First of all, the first argument, this number five here,that's how far away the camera is from the creature.Imagine I've got the creature, the creature's there and I want the camerato be a certain distance away.That five is how far the camera is away from the creature.That's the first thing.Then the next two numbers are to do with the angle of the camera.Is it pointing up and looking down at the creature or is it at an angleand things like that?The first one, 0, which means it's flat on that axis and the second one is 200,which means it's at an angle point looking at the creature like that.I just wasn't quite sure exactly how they measured it,so I just experimented to get a good number there.The final argument is the target for the camera.If you think about the camera, so we've fixed that angleand we've fixed that angle and we've fixed the distance,but then where is it looking?The idea is that it's now going to look at this position of the creature,so I'm basically pointing the camera at the current position of the creature.Let's run it again and see what happens now.Now, you can see the creature is right in frame,and the camera is moving along as the creature moves alongso we get a much better view.The only problem is now we've lost the ability to manually move the camerabecause, of course, that line is running every frameand it's updating the camera every frame.That's the walker and that's the camera fixed.The next thing I wanted to show you is what I call a runner and we'll thinkabout whether we think this is cheating or not and talk about cheating in general.This is the runner. Let's have a look at this one.You can see this one is moving really rapidly.Now, if I just run that again, but with the camera movement disabled,let's see what this one does.I don't know if you saw that. One more time.Hopefully, the frame rate's high enough that you sawthat it just whizzed off the screen.If I put enable-the-camera-following again,we can watch it zipping around.You can see it's leaping around and it's obviously figured outsome way of-- It's created a fancy ball,but it's got multiple joints in there. It's like a weird flexing joint ball.It's invented that, which is pretty cool.Maybe we don't really want creatures that can cheat like this.Often I found when I was developing this that I had cheaters that were exploitingpossibly flaws in the physics engine or limitations of the physics engine.I was actually chatting to a friend and colleague who I worked withover in Australia, John McCormack, who actually knew Karl Sims.He said that Karl Sims said these kinds of cheats and thingswere a really good way of testing, making sure your physics engineis correct, because the more correct it is,the more difficult it is to cheat.I've given you a link to this surprising creativity paper later,which actually shows a bunch of examples of this kind of thing.Now, let me just show you one more if I just play this file.This one is a really interesting one, which if we look at this,you can see that it's spinning around and it builds up this momentumand spins itself around.Then finally, once it builds up enough momentum,it whizzes off into the air, which is pretty fantastic.I'm not sure if it's cheating, maybe it's cheating because I thinkit might have been exploiting some feature of the way the joints work.Some springiness of the joints to make this energyfrom nowhere so it could fly.When I saw that one, I thought, yes, that's amazing,but I'm pretty sure it's cheating.This is the question, is it cheating and what can we do about it?What you'll find when you start running this a few timesis sometimes the fitness will suddenly leap upfrom around a distance of 10, and then it'll suddenly leap upinto 200 or 100.That typically means you've got something a bit like my runner,you've got something that's figured out a way of getting a big burst of energyto whizz off.What you can do is you can actually improveyour fitness function.What it means is the genetic algorithm is working.It's successfully finding out the best way to exploit the situationsuch that it can move as fast as possible because that's what you've asked it to do.This is a really important thing that you'll learnas you get more into machine learning and AI.This is what happens.It just tries to find the simplest solutionor the quickest solution best solution that it can.That's what the algorithm does, so it is up to you to limit itand stop it from doing the wrong thing.For example, if you don't want things to move at excessive speed,what you can do is you can monitor their speed as they're being evaluated.If the speed looks like it's too high, then you can just set that creaturewith a fitness of zero and get it out of the population.That's the way to do it, or you can just replace itwith a new random creature because it's obviously a failed linethat's learned how to cheat. There's all kinds of things.It's all about improving your fitness functionand probably then maybe looking a bit at the physics engine and seeingif you can tweak it a bit to make that less easy to do.Things like the inertia properties on the joints and thingsyou can adjust those to fix some of those problems.It's a fascinating world where we're looking at herewhere the algorithm is exploiting the environmentthat we're placing it in and finding the best solutionto the problem we've given it, which is fast movement, basically.I'm just going to wrap it up there.In the discussion threads and things, I'm encouraging you to go offand create and find interesting cheaters and interesting, good solutions as wellthat aren't cheating like my walker.Post those.If you can get videos on there and links to videos,just share it with other people because it's so interesting seeingall of these different things that grow.It's like a biology experiment. That's it.What we've been doing we've just been looking at a few examplesof evolved creatures and I've been pontificating a bitabout why that's interestingand different factors that are going on there.We looked at a slow-moving walker and then we learnedabout how to get the camera to follow the creature in case it's really fast.Then we looked at a runner and finally at the end therewe were just sort of discussing how you can deal with thingsthat look like they're cheating.In this video, we've just been discussing the outcomesof some of these evolutionary runs and looking at some interesting examples."
