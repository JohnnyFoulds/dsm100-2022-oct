  "transcript": "[music]In this video, I'm going to attempt to give youan evolution theory crash course.In summary, we're going to start by looking at the context.In other words, why am I giving you an evolution theory crash course,and then we're going to talk about the selection of breeding cycle,genotypes, phenotypes, and how selection works.Let's jump into it and get started.First of all, we're going to look at a particular fieldof biologically inspired computing which is the genetic algorithmin later videos.What I want to do here is show you the evolution theorythat inspires these algorithms.I'm going to jump over to my drawing program hereand attempt to draw you a illustrationof the selection and breeding cycle.It all starts out with three stages really.Let's just draw a circle for each of those stages.You've seen a sneak preview of this on my slide.I'm going to draw it because maybe it's more interestingto see it being built up over time.We start off and we have a population.Population which has variation and heredity.Let's think about variation.Variation means there are different things in it.Different versions of the creature.I'm going to come up with this six-legged creaturethat's going to have slight variations on it.That's a long one with a small headand that one's a shorter, bigger-headed one.Maybe we could have a really tiny one.We've got our variation.We've got different versions of the funny six-legged creature,and they're all the same species if you like, but they're justslightly different versions of it.The key thing about this variation is its inheritable.There's heredity.It means that if these creatures are to reproduce,they will come up with creatures which look a bit similar to thembut there may be variations, especially if they're crossbreeding.If you bread the one with the big head with the one with the small head,maybe you'd get a medium-sized head or whatever.The idea is that they can pass on their characteristicsfrom one generation to the next.The next thing is that in order to decide who is going to passon their characteristics we say, 'Well, they have some test.\" This one.What we're going to say is this one has to climb a hillin order to get to some food.There's the food at the end there.It looks like a speaker at a rave but that's okay.There's food.He's trying to get to the food.If he gets the food, then that's great.That means he can then go on to Stage 3 which we're goingto talk about in a minute.We're going to test each of them. Maybe we test the big head one as well.He has to climb up the hill or it has to and it has a problem.Maybe its head's too big so it can't quite climb up the hill.It's going to get stuck and it won't get the fluidor it doesn't get as much food because the other one got there firstand ate most of it, whatever it is.The idea is depending on how successful they are in lifewhich might be just climbing a hill, then dictates how successful they areat passing their genes onto the next generation.What we can say in the third stage then, so we've got Stage 1, 2 tests.Variation with heredity, test, and then selection.At this point we do selection.Selection -- actually that would be breeding.Let's do that.We'll call that selection because that's where we're selecting.Then finally, in the breeding stage, we're going to say,\"Well, the successful ones get to propagateand there's basically more of them.\"That's going to be the little one because he managed to run up the hill,get the food, and maybe the really long onewas successful as well. We'll put one of those in there.Maybe it changed a little bit because it combinedwith one of the big head ones, and so we ended upwith some long arms in that one as well.We ended up with a new population.A new population comes through with variation again basedon that selective pressure.That's the essence of evolution through natural selection.The idea is over time that the characteristics vary,and the entities might undergo changes, mutations.If there's radiation or just general mistakesin the DNA copying or some bacterial infusion,whatever it is, can change the genetic materialof the creatures so that over time new variation comesand is tested and the population as a whole changes over time.That's the basic idea.It's very simplified but it gives you the idea.Now, moving on.The genotype encodes the range of characteristicsof the individual.What do I mean by that?Well, essentially we talk about nature and nurture.Nature is what it comes with.Nature is what's in the DNA.It's like this is the range of possible thingsyou might be able to do.Let's say you had two identical animals that had the same DNA,but they each experience different things, or maybe one doesn't have much accessto food for some reason.Maybe it ends up being lost on the wrong side of the riverand then the other one has access to loads of food.Yes, at the end of their life, they're going to be different.They're still going to have the same DNA but they're going to be different.That's what we mean by nature and nurture.Nurture is the process that it goes through in its lifeand nature is what it starts out with which defines the boundsof what it might be able to do.Again, this is not a super-precise definitionof evolution, but it's giving the idea that there's these two things,nature and nurture. The genotype is the DNA strands basically.Now, there's another thing called the phenotype which is how the individualends up in the world.The example we saw earlier of the things that grew up in the different sideof the river with different access to food,one might get really tall and large and the other one might be smallerbecause they didn't have as much food, and that's the phenotype.The phenotype is what we can see, how the genotype manifests in the world,if you'd like, as a result of the nurture.In terms of how DNA is expressed into a phenotype, let's just go backto my drawing over here and I'm going to tryand very briefly explain how DNA works.DNA is a four-letter sequence.It has four different letters: A, G, T, and C, and those are the lettersof the DNA alphabet. It's that simple.Then the DNA that you will find in a cell will be made up of different sequencesof these letters, and so that's what you have.That'd be your DNA.Then what happens next is we need to get this DNAand do something with it.As the organism is growing and their genes are being expressedthrough this amazing machinery that we all have inside us, what happensis basically the simplified way the DNA is expressed is it gets convertedinto proteins and those proteins then help build the animaland control what it does.Going back to cybernetics, it's about control, and coordination,and communication. DNA is the essence of this.DNA and how it gets expressed into proteins.This is cybernetics right here.How does it work?You get three of theseand they'll be mapped to one amino acid.Proteins are made out of strings of amino acid foldedinto three-dimensional structures.How does that three go into amino acid?Well, there's a bank of 21 amino acids.At least there were last time I remember looking, [chuckles]so you've got 21 different amino acids which have all different structuresor whatever.They've got all different bits sticking out.They're basically chemicals.What we do is we say, \"Well, AAG maps on to number 2in the set of amino acids, then maybe TCA maps onto number 5and then a 6 maybe, and we've got a 1 and a 20,whatever it is.'' What we end up with is a stringof amino acids, which as I said,then that's basically protein but it foldsinto a weird three-dimensional structureof some sort where all those are bonded together.But because of the electrostatic propertiesand other things, they fold and some bits of the stringattract each other and it falls into thisincredibly complicated 3D structure.I should say that in 2021, DeepMind,the company published the human proteome.They basically worked out the whole-- We'd already sequencedthe human DNA genome many years ago,but the problem was once you've gotthat stranded DNA, what kind of protein is it going to produce?It's a very complicated problem to convert a list of amino acidsinto a three-dimensional structure because as I said,there's these complicated interactions that go on to form a 3D structure.DeepMind have solved it might've solved it with AI.They basically trained an AI to put it simply to convertfrom a string of amino acids and a bunch of knowledge about chemistryinto the 3D structures successfully.They're able to say what the 3D structures of all the proteins are that are encodedby the human genome, which is unbelievably mind-blowing.When I was studying genetics in the mid-nineties, that was unthinkable.That's very cool.Anyway, suffice to say that it's possible to get your DNA and convert itinto a 3D structure.The 3D structure is what we might call the phenotype, basically.A bunch of proteins will stick together and interact, and then they'll createan organism and that is the phenotype.That is the thing that gets tested.The environment applies to what we call selective pressureto the phenotypes.Remember this diagram here where we're looking at themclimbing up the hill and that's the selective pressurebeing applied.The phenotype is how the DNA is expressed in the world and how after interacting,the chemicals interact with the world, and the fit ones, the good ones,successful ones are able to reproduce in the next generation.That is really it.Obviously, depending on the DNA sequences, then you will end upwith slight variations in protein.If you swap out a couple of those letters, you can end upwith a different protein sequence and that's a different 3D structure,and that's a different behavior in the world.That's how the variation is expressed and tested.That was my evolution theory crash course. I hope that was useful.We come up with these key terms like the selection and breeding cycle,which we're going to be using in genetic algorithms.We have the genotype, which is the underlying string,which represents the hereditary material of the individuals.Then the phenotype, which is what that hereditary materialis expressed into. In other words, the animalor the creature or a plant,whatever it is that we're expressing it into.Then we talked a little bit about how selection is appliedto the phenotype, not to the genotype because the phenotype is the thingthat gets tested, that that's the animal that walks up the hill.The genotype is the thing which encodes its range of possible waysof walking up the hill.In this video, I've been giving you an evolution theory crash courseand introducing some of the key concepts we're going to be looking atin genetic algorithms."
