  "transcript": "[music]Congratulationsyou've reached the end of the AI gameplayer case study.I really hope you've learned a lotall about how you can buildretro video game playing AI,as well as other types of game playing AIs.Okay, so let's just review what we've been looking at.We've had five modules of content.We've had the history of the field,and the nature of the field.We looked at history,all the different games that have been played,and when big milestones were reached.In Week 2 we were looking atformalizing game playing.We looked at how we can expressthe process of learning how to play a gameinto equations,so that we can then later turn into code.In Week 3 we looked at the tooling.We are looking at the OpenAI Gym,and we were looking athow convolutional neural networkscan be used to process images.Even we had a look atwhat the inside of neural network,and what it can see.Then in Week 4we looked at the implementationof the DQN agent from DeepMind.We actually sawhow those expressionsin the research paper can be turned into code,and mechanically operatedto build a real working agent.Then in the final sectionwe were looking at the state of the art,and also consideringethical aspects of gameplay AIs.Congratulations on reaching the end of this case study.I hope you've enjoyed working through the material.I certainly enjoyed preparing it,and I'm really looking forward to seeinghow you react to this material,and to find out what you do with it next.Yes. Well done."
