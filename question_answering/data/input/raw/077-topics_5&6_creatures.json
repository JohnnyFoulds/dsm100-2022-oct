  "transcript": "In this video, I'm going to give you a quick overview of the stepswe're going to be taking in the next few videos to completeour genetic algorithm.In summary, we're just going to revisitthe GA and see where we're at on that diagram.Then we're going to talk abouthow we're going to select the parents,how we're going to apply crossover to create different childrenfrom the parents, and then how we're going to mutateand finally, iterate on those to actually implement full evolution.First off, overview of the GA.Actually, we're in this bit now where,I'm going to disappear so you can see it.We've done the selection in a way, we've almost done the selection.We've basically done the test and we've calculated the fitnessof each individual by seeing how far they move.We've done all of that, we got the simulation,we even made it multiprocess capable, so it's efficient.Finally, what we're going to do nowis we're going to select those parents,then generate the next generationfrom those, from the parents that we select.We're going to talk a bit abouthow that process works in this video really.The first part of selectionis we're going to use the roulette wheel style of selection.There are other types of selectionwhich you could implement if you wantthis other further work, but we are going to do roulette wheels.Just to remind you how that works, I'm going to quickly draw a diagram.What we do is we essentially create a wheel,if you like, which has segments in it.This example, let's say, we had a population of four,that would be creature one, creature two,creature three, and creature four.Then the angle, this angle here,is decided based on the fitness of the individual.The fitter they are, the more space they take up on the wheel.You can see that three is not very fit and one is very fit.The idea in order to select two parentsis we basically take this and we spin it around.Spin it around, we basically pick a random point on there.We pick a random point on the circle and then that's the parent oneand then we do it again,we pick another random point on the circle, and that's parent two.In this case, we've selected two and three to be the parents.That's basic roulette wheel selection.Obviously, the fitter they are,the more likely they are to be selected.We do this multiple times.If we say we're on a population sizeof 10, we'd run the wheel 20 timesbecause we need two parentsfor each new one in the next generation.That's roulette wheel selection very quickly.We'll go into more detail later.Then we're going to do crossover between the parents.Once we've selected our two parents, we basically get the two genomes.Let's say that's genome one, so that's parent one, and parent two.I've talked about this in a previous video so we [?] very quickly.The idea of crossover is we say,\"Well, we're going to take that bitof that genome, we're going to takethat bit of that genome, and that's the crossover point there.\"The child will basically have that part from parent oneand then that part from parent two,so will end up with two chunks of a genome.It has good chance of recombiningthe different bits of the two parents to come up with a new variation.That's crossover.We can do that.That example there is single point crossover,but we could do multipoint crossover, but we're just going to dosome basic stuff like a single point crossover.That's that, and then the next one is the mutation.There's various types of mutation we could do.First thing is, say we got this child genome like this.We can then jump in there,and remember the genome is made out of lots of floating point value.We can just jump in, pick a point on there go,\"Okay, I'm going to mutate that one, that one and that one.\"We could do something like we're going to mutate, say 10% of them.Then what we can do is we can add something to that value.Add some random number to that value,which could be negative or positive.That means we're going to changethat value and then we can add more onto that and add more onto that.That's the idea is that we mutatea certain number of points on the genomeso that they're slightly differentand that gives us more variation.Then, the other thing we can do is the growth and shrink mutations,which I think are quite successful and we can see how they work.The idea is that we know that a genome is made out of geneswhere each gene encodes a body parton the robot basically or the creature, and what we can dois with a shrink mutation we can say,\"Well, we going to knock out that geneso we just end up with two genes in this example.\"We can delete one entirely or we can do other things.We can add a random one, so we could put it up to four.We could add a random gene or we could make a duplicateso we could actually say,\"Well, I'm going to add that and stick it over there.\"That would give us repeated version of that part of the body.That's an interesting type of mutation as well.There's various things we can dowith growth and shrink and point mutation.The final step is to do the whole thing,to basically get this population of individuals,all the different creatures, do the selection, select to give usthe parents for the next generation,select parents, and then we do the crossover and we do the mutationon all of them and then we get another setof individuals, and then that's our next generation and we keep going.We basically then wrap it around and we go back up to the top again.That process, that repeated, iterated process and that's it.In summary, we've just been very quickly runningthrough the things that we are goingto do in the next few videos just to plant them in your brain again.We've seen most of these ideas before,but just so that we are ready when we meet them in the video.We're going to code them up and complete the genetic algorithm.In this video, we just had a quick overviewof what we're going to be doing in the next set of videos."
