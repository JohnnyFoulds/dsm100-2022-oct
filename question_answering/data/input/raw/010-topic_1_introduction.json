  "transcript": "[music]-In the previous mini-lecture, we went through the history of AI and wealso discussed where AI is now in the era of big data deployment, roboticsand substantial industry uptake.In this mini-lecture, we will talk about the state-of-the-artin AI, and we will consider some facts about AI, and also examples.AI100 is the Stanford University 100-year study on AI report.It concludes substantial increases in the future uses of AI applications,including more self-driving cost, healthcare diagnostics and targetedtreatment, and physical assistance for eldercare can be expected.The year 2021 report reports that drugs, cancer, molecular drugdiscovery received the greatest amount of private AI investmentin 2020, with more than  $13.8 billion,4.5 times higher than 2019.AI systems can now compose text, audio and images to a sufficientlyhigh standard that humans have a hard time telling the differencebetween synthetic and non-synthetic outputs for some constrainedapplications of the technology.Rapid progress in natural language processing has yielded AI systemswith significantly improved language capabilities that havestarted to have a meaningful economic impact on the world.Google and Microsoft have both deployed the BERT language modelinto their search engines, while other large language modelshave been developed by companies ranging from Microsoft to OpenAI.Machine learning is changing the game in healthcare and biology.DeepMind's AlphaFold applied deep learning techniques tomake a significant breakthrough in the decades-long biologychallenge of protein folding.The total global investment in AI, including private investmentand public offerings, increased by 40% in 2020 relative to 2019,for a total of nearly $70 billion.Despite the pandemic, 2020 saw a 9.3% increase in the amount ofprivate AI investment from 2019.Brazil, India, Canada, Singapore, and South Africa are the countrieswith the highest growth in AI hiring from 2016 to 2020.This is consistent with the result of McKinsey Global Surveys.Despite the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, half the respondentsin the McKinsey survey said that the coronavirus had no effect on theirinvestment in AI, while 27% actually reported increasing their investment.Across the 14 countries analyzed, the AI hiring rate in 2020 was 2.2 timeshigher on average than that in 2016.Demand for AI labor in six countries covered by Burning Glass data,the United States,  the United Kingdom,Canada, Australia, New Zealand, andSingapore has grown significantly in the last seven years.On average, the share of AI job postings among all jobpostings in 2020 is more than five times larger than in 2013.Overall, half of respondents say their organizations have adoptedAI in at least one function.The business functions in which organizations adopt AIremain largely unchanged from the 2019 survey with serviceoperations, product or service development, and marketing andsales, again, taking the top spot.What can AI do today?In robotics, the first demonstration of autonomous road drivingwithout guides occurred in 1980s.DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 successfully demonstrated autonomousdriving on dirt roads for 132 miles.Urban Challenge in 2007 successfully demonstrated autonomous drivingon streets with traffic.In 2018, Waymo test vehicles passed a landmark of 10 million milesdriven on public roads without a serious accident with the humantraffic stepping in to take control only every 6,000 miles.Autonomous drones have been providing cross-country blooddeliveries in Rwanda since 2016.Autonomous planning and schedule examples.In 1990s, during the Persian Gulf Crisis, US forces deployed DART,Dynamic Analysis and Planning Tool for automated logistics planningand scheduling for transportation.That involved over 50.000 vehicles, cargo and people.That had to account for transport capacities, port and airfieldcapacities, and conflict resolution and more parameters.In 2000, NASA Remote Agent was the first to use autonomous planningprogram to control the scheduling of operations for a spacecraft.It generated plans from a high-level goal specified from the groundmonitor's execution of those plans, detecting, diagnosing and recoveringfrom the problems as they occurred.In 2012, EUROPA planning toolkit is used for dailyoperations by NASA's Mars rover.In 2017, SEXTANT system allows autonomous navigation in deepspace, beyond the global GPS system.Every day, ride-hailing companies like Uber and mapping servicesas Google Maps provide driving instructions for hundreds ofmillions of users, quickly plotting an optimal route, taking intoaccount current and predicted future traffic conditions.Online machine translation systems are now reading documents in over100 languages, including the native languages of 99% population forhundreds of millions of users.Speech recognition systems reached a word error rate of 5.10%,matching human performance.About third of computer interactions are now done byvoice rather than keyboard.Skype provides real-time speech-to-speechtranslation in 10 languages.Alexa, Siri, Cortana offer assistants that can answer questions andcarry out task for the user.In this mini-lecture, we talked about the state-of-the-art in AI.AI became a part of our everyday lives, be it using AI assistantslike Alexa and Siri, using goods produced with the help of a program,or following driving instructions.Investments to AI are huge and steadily increasing and the demandfor AI specialists will remain high."
