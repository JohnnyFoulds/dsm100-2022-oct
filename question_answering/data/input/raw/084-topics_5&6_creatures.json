  "transcript": "Brilliant, you made it to the end of Week 4,so you should now have a fully functioning genetic algorithm,which allows you to evolve creatures just like Karl Sims did,well, more or less, except for the neural network part.Just like Karl Sims did back in 1994 on those amazing thinking machine systems.That's really a great achievement, so well done for getting this far.Let's just check those learning objectivesto see what we've specifically learned this week.We should now be able to explain what fitness functions areand what the population model is and how they're used in genetic algorithmsto optimize a set of solutions, especially with regard to this ideaof multiplanar sampling where you're sampling in different placesin the search base at the same time by having this populationof different solutions.Secondly, we've actually gone ahead and implemented a fitness function,as well as being able to explain what it is,we've also built one from scratch.We should have a really strong implementation knowledgeof how to go about building a fitness function.Actually, the fitness function was quite simple, wasn't it?It was really just measuring how further [?] moved in different waysand using that.There are much more elaborate fitness functions and I've encouraged youto investigate those and see what other things you might be able to useto control the evolution of your creatures.Number three is that we've been using genetic manipulation techniques,so that's the grow mutations, the shrink mutations, the crossover,and point mutation to change and interbreed and crossbreedthese different solutions to the problem, which gives usthat multiplanar sampling capability, which is one of the key featuresof a genetic algorithm.In summary, well done for reaching the end of Week 4.You've now got a fully functioning genetic algorithm.We're not going to do a whole lot more programmingon this particular case study now.Next week we're going to be looking at where this stuff went next.What has happened since 1994?Surely people have invented some cool new stuff since thenand they absolutely have.Come back next week to find out more about that."
