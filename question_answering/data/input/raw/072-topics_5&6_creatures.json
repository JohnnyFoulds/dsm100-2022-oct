  "transcript": "[music]-In this video, I'm just going to give you a quick overviewof the plan for implementing the next part of the genetic algorithm.Let's just jump over to my summary here.First of all, we're going to have a quick look at the genetic algorithm,just to remind ourselves  what the whole process looks likeand where we're at in that process.Then we're going to be looking at  how we can generate a random populationwhich is going to be pretty straightforward actually.Then we're going to be thinking abouthow we're going to run all the individuals  in a population in simulationand then how we're going to evaluate themby implementing a fitness function to measure how far they've actually moved.First of all, here's a reminder of the genetic algorithm.We start off on the left there  with a varied population with heredity.That's the random population.What we don't see in the GA-- [chuckles]what we don't see here is all that work we've doneto make this really complicated genetic encoding scheme, but that's fine.That's not a generic part of the GA.That's a specialist part that we spend a lot of effort onfor a specific problem, which is the creature's problem.The second phase is the selection phase and there we need to do some sort of test.Essentially, we're going to need a random population of individuals,then we're going to need some sort of tests,and then finally, we got this phase behind me herewhich is where we basically take the things that get the highest scores in the testand we make variations of those.We're going to be doing that  in a later video.What about generating a random population?Well, for now, we'll just going to do it in a very straightforward way.We're just going to essentially create multiple random genomesand wrap those up in a creature class,and then that will be  our random population.It's as simple as that.Then the next step will be running in simulation.We're going to create a new class again.We had a population class  for the random population.We're going to have a simulation class for the simulation.This is going to do slightly more complicated stuff.It's actually going to be able to create  a pybullet environmentwhich is going to run in direct mode  which is a different mode.Normally so far we've been running pybullet  in GUI modewhere it pops up the user interfaceand you can see the objects that we create moving around in real time in 3D.Direct mode is different  in that it runs offline,it doesn't try and render everything out  in real time as it's happening.The idea is it's a lot faster.Because we're on the run lots of these individuals in simulationand quickly evaluate themin order for the GA to complete  in a reasonable time,then we need to be able to run it fast.That's where the simulation direct mode  comes in.What we're going to do, we'll create our direct mode simulation.We need to instantiate an individual  inside the simulationwhich is similar to what we've been doing alreadyin a previous video we saw just generating a random individualand running it in real time.It's just very similar, but we'll just be in direct mode.Then we're going to have to step through time,so run the simulation as quickly as we canand update the motors as we goso that the creature is correctly moving how it should.At the end we have to end the simulation  and see what happened basically.That's the simulation.Also within the simulation I guess is we're going to have to figure outwhat the individual actually did  in the simulation,because if we just create in pybullet and then shut the simulation down,how do we know what actually happened?We going to have to add some variables  to our creature classwhich allow us to essentially monitor what it's been doing.Simply put, we're going to look at the start position and the end positionand we're going to measure how far it moved.That will be our fitness function which allows us to evaluate the individual.The farther it moves, the more fit it is.That's just a brief overview of what we're going to be doingin the next few videos.We had a quick look at the GA,and then we're thinking about random populationswhere we evaluate all the individuals  by running them in an offline simulation.At the end, we're just talking about  the fitness functionand how we're going to essentially measurehow far these creatures move  in the simulation.In this video, we just had a quick overview  of what we're going to be doingto evaluate a population of individuals."
