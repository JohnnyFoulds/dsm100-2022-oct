  "transcript": "[music]-In this mini lecture, we will talk about knowledge-based agents.We have already seen in the previous topics that knowledgemakes an agent more intelligent, be it domain-specific knowledge,or knowledge of the past experience, what worked well and what did not.The more an agent knows and remembers, the better decisions it can make.Agents that are using knowledge for making decisionsare called knowledge-based agents.This component of a knowledge-based agent is called,unsurprisingly, a knowledge base.Knowledge has to be encoded in a machine processable way,usually, using knowledge representation languages.What is knowledge?Generally, there is no clear separation in the means between data,knowledge, and information.It is often the case even in computer science.It is, well, stating explicitly what we will consider as such in this module.Data are facts.Typically, data are encoded as a table.For example, if a table stores various chemical elementsand their freezing and melting points, then an example of a data itemor a fact would be, melting point of helium is -272.2 celsius.Typically, knowledge is encoded as a set of rules.For example, if the temperature is below the melting point,then the chemical substance is in a liquid state.More advanced knowledge can be represented inthe form of an executable model.For example, a metabolic model captures our knowledge aboutthe metabolic pathways, and molecular mechanismsof a particular organism.Information is a more generic term that combines data and knowledge.Problems-specific and domain specific knowledge is called background knowledge.This can be available to a knowledge-based agentfrom the very beginning.As the agent gains experience, learns from errors,and also successful moves, it updates its knowledge.Knowledge base can be divided into declarative and procedural parts.The declarative part contains statements about the problem, domain, goals.The procedural part defines agent's behavior.An example of a knowledge-based system is a medical diagnosticsystem that uses metabolic model as the background knowledge.It can take as an input, test results of a particular patientand make inference about what metabolic pathwayscould be disrupted, and what drugs, possibly,could mitigate such disruptions.The first knowledge base systems were rule-based expert systems.One of the most famous was MYCIN, a program for medical diagnosis.MYCIN was developed in the early 1970s atStanford University by Edward Shortliffe.It could identify what bacteria were causing infections,for example, meningitis.MYCIN could recommend antibiotics with the dosage adjustedfor patient's body weight.Later in this module, we will talk about other knowledge-based systems.In this mini lecture, we introduce a concept of a knowledge-based agent,and we discuss the difference between data and knowledge,and how a knowledge base can be separated into"
