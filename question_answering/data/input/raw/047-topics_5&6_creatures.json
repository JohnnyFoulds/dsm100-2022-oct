  "transcript": "[music]-Well done, you've reached the end of the first weekof the creature's case study.At this point in time,you will have covered the following learning objectives.You should be able to explain the key featuresof a genetic algorithm and how they can be usedto address a specific problem.It's worth noting that we also had a crash coursein evolution theory,so now you should also know the basics of how evolution works,your natural selection, and actually, we're going to be usingartificial selection in our genetic algorithm.In fact, the whole thing's artificial.Secondly, you should be able to compare and contrast examplesof artificial life systems.We've seen the creature system,and we've seen the general idea of how evolution works.When you encounter artificial life in evolutionary computation systems,you should have a few tools at your disposalfor understanding what they're all about.Thirdly, you should be able to develop an argumentabout the potential of evolutionary and bio-inspired computing.I'm showing you the general area of bio-inspired computing,I'm giving you some historical examples of different research fieldswhich have explored this fascinating area.Yes, so well done for reaching the end of week one,and we'll see you in week two."
