  "transcript": "[jingle]In this mini-lecture, we will talk about how experimentsfor the robot scientist can be designed and planned.A planning agent requires knowledge about how to plan experiments.It also needs a formal description of what is in the lab,what equipment is available, and what it can do.Also, what materials are available and what are the constraintsfor planning, for example, how long experiments can last.The hypothesis generation agent is used in abductiveand inductive reasoning to formulate hypothesis.This hypothesis may be correct or they may be not.They need to be experimentally tested.It is critical to understand that not all hypotheses can be tested.We can't check every guess we may have like why stop the phone call with me?I need to check that with Ann, and Ann might not wish to answer my question,and I will be left with unconfirmed guesses.The same is with experimentation, especially automated experimentation.Some hypothesis operationally impossible to testor maybe they can be tested in one laboratory but not in the other.That depends on the available equipment, materials, and other resources.Maybe a hypothesis can be tested,but then something related to that hypothesis can be tested.Then from the test results it can be inferredif the hypothesis is correct or not.This is how it is often done.For example, in functional genomics,it is impossible to experiment with genes directly.Instead, an experiment is designed with a proxy for a gene of interest,and then a gene function may be inferred from the experimental results.I will explain how planning of experiments can be doneon the example of Adam planning of functional genomics experiments.To recap, Adam has a yeast metabolic pathways modelencoded in logic and it can abduce hypothesis about what genesare controlling what chemical reactions.For example, Adam can abduce that several genes might be responsiblefor biosynthesis of prephenate from chorismate.Moreover, it uses bioinformatics databasesto find out what enzyme catalyzes this reaction.It is a class of enzymes, EC.2.6.1.39.The hypothesis can be represented in Prolog S,\"Gene and the class of enzyme.\"It is also important to capture negative hypothesisnot, gene enzyme class.A set of this hypothesis is an input to a planning agent.The planning agent needs to know what resources are availablefor experimentation, equipment and its functionality, materials,and it also needs a knowledge basewith rules for planning of experiments.We developed LABORS,Laboratory Automation Ontology for Robot Scientiststo capture knowledge about experiments run by the robot scientistsand to assist in experiment planning.It is available at the link provided on this slide.The planning agent will check the list of available materialsand it will find the genes YER060c and YER152c are not in the list.What is available is yeast strains with those genes removed.Experiments can be designed with them as proxy and not with genes.Such rules should be in the experiment planning knowledge base.This is a common experimental approach used in functional genomics,since it is not possible to directly observeor experiment  with genes functions,experiment under the cellsor organisms having  those genes removed.It is like trying to determine the function of a steering wheel in a carby removing it and then observing what would happen.It can be observed then, the engine still can work.Say for inference, starting an engine is not a steering wheel function,but is no longer possible to turn the wheels, therefore, it can be inferredthat the function of the steering wheel is to control or turn the wheels.It is the same as functional genomics.The planning agent designs experimentswith yeast strains that have those genes removed.To observe if its behavior has changed.If gene YER152c is indeed responsible for the synthesis of prephenate,then without the gene, prephenate will not be producedand yeast cell will die.This can be determined in a yeast growth experiment.Still, yeast can die for some other reason.Can a more conclusive experiment be designed?Yes, it is possible to add metabolites or small moleculesto the growth medium to restore the growth of yeast,then the experimental results will be more conclusiveabout the gene function.Without the gene, yeast can't grow, but if a metabolitecan stimulate production of prephenate, then it can.There are several metabolites that can compensatefor the missing gene including lysine.This knowledge again comes from the knowledge base.Now, the blanket agent can replace the initial hypothesis,\"gene enzyme function,\" by a proxy, affect growth metabolite yeast strain.The predicate affects growth, corresponds to the representationof what can be observed in the lab.The lab has optical density readers that can scan yeast cultureto determine if it is growing or producing more cells or not.Now we have a testable in-the-lab set of hypotheses.Metabolites and yeast strains are in the list of materialsand the equipment has the functionality to observeif yeast growth has been affected or not.This slide shows the representation of hypothesesfor the robot scientist, Adam.Experiment plan knowledge base should contain rulesreflecting good experimental design practice.For example, experiments require inclusion of controls.The best control is a comparison of the growth of deletant yeast strainswith the growth of so-called wild yeast with no genes removed.The recommended duration of yeast growth experiments is 48 hoursand the recommended temperature is 30 to 37 degrees Celsius and so on.Unfortunately, in the reality, there are still no such experiment,plan, and knowledge bases.The necessity for planning informationusually is added by human scientistsand also many shortcuts are used.For example, hypotheses from the beginning must be aboutentities that are available in the lab.Planning agent has to produce an experimental protocolto test the input hypothesis.An experimental protocol is a list of experimental actionswith specified parameters for the robotic lab to execute them.For example, at 50 milliliters of YPD mediumto 500 milliliters conical flask,experimental protocols can be complicated, containing many steps,producing them requires elaborate planning.To support planning for the robot scientist,we develop an ontology EXACT experimental actions.It defines typical experimental actions like add, move, inoculate, shake,and set parameters like temperature, speed of shaking,and duration of shaking.EXACT cools experimental actions in RDF,Resource Description Framework,on this slide you see an example of how experimental actionscan be represented in a textual form suitable for humans to understand.The experimental protocol was represented in RDF first,and then translated to a textual format.An experimental protocol in EXACT is a high-level protocol,the level at which human scientists plans their experiments.This protocol needs to be translated further to a low-levelMachine process-able protocol.Different pieces of lab equipment may requiredifferent inputs in different formats.That depends on the supplier of the equipment.Integration of various tools in one lab is a challenging task,there is a lot of research into supportinginteroperability of automated labs.For example, SILA standard enables communication of open systems,integration of instruments, and also lab systems to each other.In this mini-lecture, we inspected how robot scientistscan produce experimental protocols to test hypotheses formulatedby the hypothesis generator.Experimental planning is a highly demanding task requiringsophisticated reasoning over knowledge about experiments.Robot scientists can carry out thousands of experiments in parallel,testing many hypotheses at the same time.Human scientists are not good in parallel tasking,but they're better than robot scientistsat the high-level planning of experiments.In reality, experiments are planned jointlyby human and robot scientists."
