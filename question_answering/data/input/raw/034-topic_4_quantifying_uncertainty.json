  "transcript": "[music]In this mini lecture, we will lookat how uncertainty in the environmentcan be handled by a rational agent.Uncertainty can be due to various factors:knowledge gaps,contradictory information from different sources,or just is the caustic nature of the environment.Intelligent agent should be able to make decisions under uncertainty.In this mini lecture, we will talkabout how to quantify and represent uncertainty.Intelligent agents may need to handle uncertaintybecausethe environment is partially observable,or the environment is nondeterministic,or both the environment partially observable and nondeterministic.For that, an agent need to represent the uncertain knowledgeand also to reason over uncertain knowledge.An example of uncertain reasoning is diagnosing a dental patient's toothache.Diagnosing,be it a medical diagnosingor diagnosing of malfunctioning equipmentalmost always involves uncertainty.We can try using logic to write rules for dental diagnosing,like if toothache, then cavity.The problem isthat this rule doesn't represent the knowledge and reasoning process well.Not all patients with toothache have cavities.To say can indicate other consequences like gum disease or abscess.To make the rule correct,we will have to add all possible consequences,and it may be difficult to do.If toothache,then cavity, or gum problem, or abscess,or something else or something else, we may even not know.From the other hand,cavity does not necessarily is manifested as toothache.There can be many other reasons for developing cavity.This example shows that it is hard to capturesuch uncertain knowledge as medical knowledgeusing pure propositional logic.Logic is not the best option for capturing uncertain knowledgebecausewe often can't enumerateall possible outcomes, symptoms, causes.Our knowledge is often limited, uncertain, and it has gaps.Or it can be difficult to do from practical considerations.There can be too many possibilities to list.Instead, we can provide a degree of beliefin such statement as if to say exam cavity.We can express a degree of belief as the probability of the event.To say it leads to cavity with probability 0.8.Probability theory is a generally accepted wayto represent such knowledge.Probability provides a way of summarizing the uncertaintiesthat can be due various factors,like knowledge gaps, too many options to count,or contradictory information from different sources of knowledge.We might not know what afflicts a particular patient,but we believe that there is 80% chance or probability 0.8that the patient who has a toothache has a cavity.Such a belief could be derivedfrom statistical data about patient with toothache and cavities,if such data is available,or general dental knowledge,or from a combinationof various sources of evidence and knowledge.How to make rational decisions in uncertain situations.Consider an exampleof an agent deciding how to catch a flightto get to the airport in time.Option 1, follow a short route,but it has a high chance of traffic jams and the possibility of missing the flight.Option 2, follow a short route,but start two hours in advanceto minimize the possibility of missing the flight.Option 3,follow a long routewith less traffic and a small chance of missing the flight.If it is absolutely imperative to be on that flight,Option 4 can be the best choice.Drive to the airport the night before and wait for the flight.In most situations, Option 4 is not desirablebecause a too long wait doesn't justifya decrease in the possibility of missing the flight.To enable the agent to make a decision,preferences between different outcomes have to be defined.It can be expressed as a utility function.Each output can be assigned with a utility valueand a rational decision would be to maximize the utility value.An important consideration, though, is that the utility values are relative.Different agents or different users may have different preferences.For example, in a chess game,some players will be happy to have a draw,while many will be determined to win the game.Preferences expressed as utilitiescombined with probabilitiesin the general theory of rational decisionsare called decision theory.An agent is rationalif and only ifit chooses the actions that yields the highest expected utility,averagedover all the possible outcomes of the action.This is calledthe principle of the maximum expected utility(MEU).In this mini lecture [?]a great way of handling uncertaintyis to quantify it via probabilities.Probabilities can be used to expressa belief that the certain proposition is correct.There are, of course, other ways of handling uncertainty.However, probability theory isa well developed, well supported, and widely used mechanismfor reasoning over uncertain knowledge."
