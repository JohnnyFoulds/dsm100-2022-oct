  "transcript": "[music]-In this mini-lecture, we will consider the state-of-the-art of robot scientists.Of course, there are many projects in scientific discovery,automated discovery, but I will tell you about our projects.Projects that I know inside out, I know what we are targeting.I will tell you about something which is not published yet,and what other people still have no opportunity to know about.I will tell you about two new projects.The first project is Action on cancer.Action stands for a decision support system for the treatment of cancer.Several organizations are involved to this projectis the University of Cambridge & Goldsmiths College,the University of London.The project is funded by Research Council UK,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.It's £1.4 millionfor this project and it's four years duration of this project.I am Principal Investigator in Goldsmiths.The aim of this project is to develop a prototype AI systemfor the design of personalized cancer treatments.There are many therapies for cancer,but this project is focusing on design of drug cocktails.I will tell a little bit more about it in a minute.Longer-term aim is to perform equally or even better than human oncologists.There's AI systems that will make recommendations for treatmentson the level of experts, oncologists, or better than them.The motivation for this project is that canceris one of the world's greatest killers.13 million deaths and 20 million new cases per year is estimated by 2025.According to World Health Organization,it's every second person on the planet will develop cancerat some stage of their life.Of course, research programs for investigating cancers,biological projects, and the AI projects, the research programs are well funded,they're substantial, but they still cannot addressall the challenges because it's a very complex disease,and we are far from finding really good treatments for cancer.We are very far from solving this huge problem.However, over the last decades,our knowledge about cancer has increased enormously.We now understand the fundamentals of this disease.The major factor is malfunctioning of information processing in cells.Something is happening with signaling, it is disrupted,and cells start behaving differently.They no longer obey commands,they don't behave how they should behave and it is how tumors start to growand then how cancer develops further.We started to understand the biological side of it.It's still not enough to find good treatments of this disease.The treatment is complex.There are many therapists, for example, radiotherapy is very aggressive therapy.Immunotherapy it's less aggressive and very promising.There is a lot of research in this area.One of therapies is chemotherapy when it's treated by drugs.Traditionally, a single drug is a sign with attempt to kill these tumor cells,but our metabolic network is very complex and cancer can easily find ways aroundand develops resistance to these drugs.Action project focuses on finding a combination of many drugs,something between 6 and 12 is the recommended number.This is a more effective treatment because it's harder to develop resistanceat the same time to so many drugs.Even if cancer would develop resistance to one or two drugs,it means it will be weakened against other drugs.Cocktail of drugs working better than single drug,but you still want to find such cocktails that is quite individually tunedto individual patients because cancer it's very individual disease.Even if you take twins,their cells have acquired significant differencesthat can dictate different development of cancer.The focus of Action project is first,personalized treatments or genetic information is taken into account.We still don't have access to medical history data,but if we will get such data also we want to include historywith medical treatment with reactions.At least we now have access to genetic information.Existing cancer model can be amended,taking into account this personal information,genetic information.Also, it's personalized and because it's combination of drugs,it's more effective because it's harder to develop resistance.In such cases, because we talk about combinationof drugs since there are thousands of drugs,and if we want combinations, we have combinatorial explosion.Computational simulation is absolutely essential.Then most promising combinations should be testedwith cell culture to see if it really makes sense or notif cancer cells are being killed and at the same timehealthy cells are not killed so it's not toxic to them.Arguments here is fairly simple.While computational approaches by AI approaches are vital importance here,it's simply because we don't have enough blood cells to experimentwith all possible combinations of drugs.Before running any experiments, we first have to narrow down this search space.This is an overview of the project.On this diagram you can see the key components of the systemsthat we are working on. It's the heart of robot scientists.It is automated labs that can test hypothesis.A hypothesis will be about this combination of drugs [?].In other projects, we were using yeast strains.Experiment in this yeast.In this case, is mammalian cells.Cells from biological organism and test on them if this combinationof drugs it doesn't kill cancer cells.It's not toxic, but it can kill cancer cells.This is the idea.This is how it will be tested and how to come up with suggestions.First, you need to combine all data you have,all knowledge you have because there are cancer models.We have some understanding how cancer works,but it's all generic models.They're not tuned for individual patients with genetic information.You see on the slide, example like there are public databases,there are clinical trials, the Cancer Genomic Atlas,Human Phenotype Ontology, National Cancer Institute [?].There are many resources.Plus, we have agreement with some companiesthat are working with patients and they're doing screeningof the tissues.We have an agreement that we are doing data analytics for themand they're giving us this data.After they're putting it all together,we do a lot of reasoning and we try to come up with these suggestions.What combination of drugs achieves the desired effect?If everything works well,then such AI systems that can advise these cocktails will be ableto output this personalized cancer model and also these recommendations.Then on some next stage, then it can be testednot only in lab settings but on some may be startingfrom mice.Whatever future developments will be here.Another project I would like to tell you about is called Ambition.It's a completely new project.It's also with the University of Cambridge & Goldsmiths.I'm a Principal Investigator in Goldsmiths.It also with lab automation companies that this named Arctoris.It is located near Oxford.This is a relatively small project, £300.000.Also funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council UK.It's just for one year, but it is the first stage.We hope that it will be extended for further stages.Within this first phase of the project,the main proposal is to harness the power of AI and automated experimentationto provide researchers in the UK and beyondwith continuous uninterrupted remote accessto AI/robotic augmented biomedical research capabilities.The motivation for this project is that during the pandemic,it was clearly demonstrated that biomedical researchis of vital importance,and it's critical to maintain research continuitybecause many labs that could work on developmentof drugs to fight this disease, including our labs,they were closed during pandemic.The lockdown and social distancing pose serious threat to research community.Many laboratories were closed and years of research were lost because of that.What we are proposing in this project is to develop a demo lab to showthat it's possible to carry out all these experiments remotely.Not just that experiments but enhanced by AI technology and to have this closedcycle of robotic experiments.This slide shows an overview of the system.It's a modular system.In the middle is APIs that can connect to other components.The components that we already have like hypothesis generation agent,planner agent, data analysis, experimental results analysis agent,they all can interact with API with this interface.Also, robotic pieces of equipment also can interact with this API.If necessary, there can be lab technicians.It can be semi-automated or it can be fully automated.The main idea is that it is remote system and users, scientists,they can access it from anywhere anytime so they can just send their tasksand this lab will be working towards this task.Design experiments, run experiments, record everything.Hopefully, also provide explanation and feedback.It can be just experimental results, or it can be models.This is what we will be working on.What I would like to stress is that such automated laboratorieson particular Ambition doesn't aim to replace humans.The aim is to empower them by reasoning and data processing capabilitiesto support their decision making,and especially if it's possible to do remotely.It will enable a paradigm shift towards real-time treatmentsupported by continuous testing of novel drug combinationson patient-derived tumor materials.Because this robotic lab can work non-stop,the scientist or practitioners, they just can send this task,test this, test that and see if we'll have continuous resultsso decisions can be made and changed quickly.Essentially, this bridging the bench and bedside,where patient-derived tumor material can be tested in real-timeand treatment decisions can be adjusted accordingly,reducing side effects and improving efficiency.It is longer-term vision.Hopefully, we will be able to continue this project.Even as the first stage,if we can achieve this to show that the research labs can workin fully autonomous and remote fashions, that will be a big step forward.In this mini-lecture, I presented two new projectsthat involve robot scientists.Of course, there are many more projects on knowledge discovery,but I talked about our projects because I know them inside out.I know what our aims, I know where we are with this.What I presented, it's not published. You will not find it anywhere else.This is an opportunity for you to learn about the real state of the art.What scientists are doing, what they're working on,what they're aiming,what published papers in five years will tell about.Hopefully, they will tell about the results of this project.Of course, there will be many more publicationstelling results of other ongoing projects."
