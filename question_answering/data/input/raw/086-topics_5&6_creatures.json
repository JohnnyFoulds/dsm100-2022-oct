  "transcript": "-In this video, I'm just going to give a brief overview of some paperswhich I've dug up,which carry on in the vein of Sims of evolving interesting morphologiesfor moving creatures.These are the things we're going to be looking at some of the themesthat have developed since Sims.First of all, we're going to look at a paper where they evolvedhard body robots in simulation similar to the things that we're doing,and they then were able to actually 3D print those outinto real robots, which could move around.Then we're going to be looking at some soft robot studieswhich is where the things went next after the hard body stuff.These are deformable robots that can bend and squashin different ways.There's various papers we're going to briefly look at which evolvedsoft body robots,and even a couple of them where they actually were ableto implement these in real robots.Finally, at the end, I'm going to show you a paperwhich I really urge you to read which just gives lots of examplesof evolving morphologies, and interesting stuff happeningwith artificial evolution, and soft creatures, and so on.The first paper is Lipson and Pollack 2000 paper,which was published as a letter in Nature magazine,because, I think, at the time, this was pretty hot stuff.It's quite exciting because people knew about Karl Sims.They knew it evolved these creatures in simulation.What was different about this paper is they evolved them in simulation,but then we're able to manufacture them using what was probably thenquite an early version of 3D printing.Let me just show you roughly what it looks like.I can't show you the pictures, unfortunately, due to copyright reasons.This is roughly what they were doing.They had these sticks, if you like, and they had joints,and then they had motors.You could essentially build a robot out of a bunch of joined together sticksin different forms.Then you could print the sticks out, and the stickswill have different connecting angles here.You can 3D print these sticks,then you'd have to stick some little motors in,and then off they go.The motors would be controlled by some sort of microcontroller,presumably, which would basically give it the action.Having looked at the Sims thing in such detail in the last many videos,you've now got real insight into how you might go about doing that.Also having looked at all this code in great detail,and knowing what it's all about, you're probably really good at thinking,what are the questions to ask when you're going into a paper,because when I'm reading research papers,often you can get lost and bogged down in the detail.Now we've looked at this area in detail, we've got good questions.Now the questions I'm going to ask you this paper are,what's the encoding scheme?How did the fitness function work?Those are the things we're going to be asking.I've looked it up in the paper.The population size was 200, so that gives us some insight there.They were evolving for several 100 generations,you can see there.The robots are represented by a string of integers and floating point numbersthat describe bars, neurons, and their connectivity.It did actually have a neural network controller,which was controlling the motors, very similar to the thingthat we implemented a rhythmic motor control system.The fitness function was just the distance moved in simulation,you can see there.As I said, they printed them with 3D printingwith a microcontroller's controller.That's the first paper.Obviously, I'm going to give you a link to this.You can go and read it.The second paper is Hiller and Lipson's 2012 paperwhere they reported on a system which allowed them to evolvesoft robots in simulation.As I mentioned earlier, soft robots are deformable robots,maybe made out of foam with little motors embeddedin and stuff like that, where you can actually bendand deform the robot.They're not like hard bodied robots that can't deform.They were able to evolve these things in simulation.Actually, they were able to do some rudimentary manufacturethese robots as well, but it's not totally clearhow advanced that part of the work was.You can read the paper and find out more.In 2014, Cheney, MacCurdy, Clune, and Lipson, so Lipson again,worked on this new version of the system where they got bit moreinto the evolution of soft body.They had a more advanced version of the soft body robot thing.It's worth knowing that I think Jeff Clune is now at Uber.I think it was released at the time of filming.I think he's the head of research at Uber now.In 2014, Jeff Clune was messing about buildingthese amazing evolving soft robots.That just shows you the kind of pathways that people take.Now, going back to my thing about--Okay, you know what kind of questions to ask now.The genetic encoding scheme was they made the robots out of deformable voxels.The thing that was being evolved was the neural network,which generated the creature, which is quite interesting.Let me just draw a diagram to maybe explain that a bit more.The idea is that you've got this cube like this,or a cuboid in this case.You've got a cube.The objective is to build a robot inside the cube.You have this neural network, which is the subject to the evolution.The neural network generates signals in different ways.It's more of a signal generating network, maybe than a neural network.Those signals dictate which of three materialsyou're going to choose.You've got three different materials you can spray in there,and also where they're going to go.What it does essentially is it goes--I'm going to put a bunch of that stuff over in the corner there.These are all deformable cubes really.Then they might switch to another type of stuff and put that over there.There may be a switch down here.It's the network that's controlling the spray gun, if you like.This is not how they describe it in the paper.This is how I understand it.It's my simplified description of it,this idea of a neural network controlled spray gunthat spray voxels of three different materialsinto the space.What happens is then, I think they choose the biggest lump,and then that will be the creature basically.Anything that's not connected to it, they throw it away.You end up with this creature made out of lumps.There's some great videos on YouTube, which unfortunately,I can't show you here because of copyright.They're all there. I'll give you links.You can go and look at them.This is the idea.Eventually, the soft body robot have these three material types.One would be like a muscular type thing that could screech and move.The other ones might just be a spongy thing, or a hard thing.Any other robot then could have different patternsof these materials in there.They have all some really interesting gatesand ways of moving in this work.Moving forward, actually I'll leap into 2021,just to show you people are still doing this stuff.In 2021, there was a research paper published in Nature,machine intelligence,where they were looking at actually evolving morphable robots.The subject to the evolution was not so much the whole formof the robot,but the way in which it can morph from one shape to another.Again, this one had a hardware component.They're actually implementing these in hardware.For example, you might have a strip of deformable material.It could form into a wheel and roll along,and then it might change shape into an inchworm and do that movement,depending on the terrain.They were looking at changeable robots that could adapt appropriate controland shape for different contexts.The final paper that I'm going to mention is this one here.You'll notice that these are some of these familiar names here.Clune was on this one.Also, Peter Bentley worked a lot in this field as well.This paper just presents a whole load of examples of different systems,which were able to create really interesting formsand behave in unexpectedly creative ways.It's a nice, interesting paper that summarizes--It's from 2020.I'm looking back on lots of the older work,and also some of the more recent work and trying to show yousome great examples.I recommend reading this which is quite long,but it's a really interesting article.In this video,we've just been looking at some state-of-the-art papers,and also looking at what happened after Sims,what people did building on these hard bodies, robots,and working towards actually implementing themin the real world by using 3D printing, and also looking at soft body robotswhich could deform and have different types of materials in them,and really just going to the next level from where Simswas at with these creatures work.We also finally looked at this set of really interesting anecdotesfrom key researchers in the field, who think this stuff's really interesting,and gave you examples of when it's very creativeand comes up with unexpected solutions to problems and that kind of thing.In this video, we've just been reviewing some papers that happenedafter Sims that were evolving robot morphologies in different ways."
