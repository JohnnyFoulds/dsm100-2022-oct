  "transcript": "[music]In the previous mini-lecture,we talked about rational agentsand their environment.In this mini-lecture, we will discuss furtherhow to specify the task environmentfor an intelligent agent.To specify the task environment for an agent,one has to describe its environment,sensors, actuators,  and the performance measure.All together it is called the PEAS description.The table in the slide showsseveral examples of such description.Task environments can havemany different properties.We will briefly considersome of the most important ones.We will come back to some ofthese properties later in this module.The environment is fully observableif agent's sensors give accessto the complete state of the environmentat each point of time.The environment is partially observableif agent's sensors give accessto a partial state of the environment,for example, due to noiseor inaccurate sensors.Or some of the environmentcan be observed by the agent's sensors.This concept is connectedto the performance measure.For example, for the English tutor agent,students' scores may not be observableby the agent,  because they may need to befirst approved by a human teacher,and it may take too long.However, students' answers  are observable.If the performance measure  includes scores,then the environment is partially observable.If it includes only answers, then it is fully observable.Unobservable, this sounds likean extremely difficult situation,but it can be solvable.It all depends on the explorationand learning stages.Single agent versusmulti-agent environment.For example, playing chessis a two competitive agents environment.Multi-agent environment also can be cooperative.For example, robots working on the same task.Agents can share tasksor have their own tasks.They can share prior knowledge or have their own.Sometimes contradictory to others.Communication and interactionbetween agents is a hot area of research.I listed a couple of recommended articlesabout multi-agent systems.Please have a look if you're interestedin this topic.A newly emerging area of researchis communication and interactionbetween artificial agents and humans.There is a dedicated journal of human-robot interaction.Interestingly, for example,in chess, teams of humansand software agents are superior to teamsof only computer agents or to teams of humans.Perhaps, it is true for other areas of activities,and in the future,we will see more of human-computerrobotics cooperation and co-creation.An environment is deterministicif the next state of the environmentis completely determined by the current stateand the agent's actions.If not, then it is stochastic environment.Some environments are considered stochasticfor practicality.For example, if it is a complex,partially observable environment.A related concept is uncertain environment.It is a nondeterministic environmentwhere actions are characterizedby possible outcomes,or if the environment is not fully observable.An environment is staticif the state of the environment doesn't changewhile the agent is deciding what to do.If not, then it is a dynamic environment,continuously asking an agent what it wants to do.For example, a self-driving car.If an agent doesn't do anything,then it is also a decision,and the environment will keep changing.Semidynamic environment.The environment doesn't change with time,but it is changed  by agent's performance score.Discrete versus continuous environment.The state of the environmentcan be discrete or continuous.The passage of time  can be discrete or continuous.Perception actions also can be discreteor continuous.Our example, the vacuum cleaner worldis a very simple world.It is fully observable, single agent,deterministic, static, and discrete.It can be modified to a more complex agent.An environment  can be partially observableif it is unknown what is in different locations.It can be multi-agent with many cleaners.Dynamic, if dirt appears randomly.Continuous, if dirt appears continuously.As you can see,artificial agents can be simple or complex.They are characterized by their sensorsand actuators.Their behavior depends on the environmentand also on performance measures."
