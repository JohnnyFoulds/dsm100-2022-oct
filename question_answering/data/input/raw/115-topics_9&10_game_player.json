  "transcript": "[music]-In this video, I'm going  to be presenting a few milestonesthat have happened in the AI game, playing research.In summary, we're going to talk about the early years and then we're going to go through various things,  Computer Olympiadand we're going to look at a few things  that have happened in various decadesjust to see where we're at with AI game players.Now, I'll just say at this point that I'm going  to show you loads of different papers.What I want you to do is,  if you play any of these gamesor you're particularly interested  to find out how any of these systems work,then I encourage you to go off,  find the papers, read around,find out how the algorithms work  and follow your interest really.I'm just laying out some of the milestones  here for you to follow off on yourself.Okay.Right, so the early years.Now, some of these things  I'm talking about in this video are derivedfrom this really nice research paper  where Schaeffer, who actually worked on game plays,  AIs that play checkers or drafts as we know it in the UK.He talks about some of the early years  and history of early game players right up to quite recently,  actually, it's the 2001 article.He covers that first 50 years really of research.I've found some of the research articles  that you'll see in that article.The early years, in 1950, Shannon  actually defined what's one of the very firstformal descriptions of a chess playing algorithm.Okay.That's Shannon.If you've heard of the name Shannon before  you might remember a very famous information theorist  who talked about how it's possibleto represent information in binary,  how much resolution you needto represent different types of information  and different types of data.A really important figure  in this who also happened to just knock out  the first chess playing algorithm.Apparently, Alan Turing was aware  of this algorithmand implemented it by hand and hand executed it  because he didn't have a machineor resources to run it all of the timeand was able to show that it could play chess,  but it wasn't very good.Well, probably Alan Turing is pretty good  at chess though, let's face it.Okay.Moving on, in 1952, we saw one of the first checkers  or drafts playing systems, which as I said is Schaeffer's area.This one, as you can see from the title,  logical or non mathematical programs in proceedings of the ACM.This is, I guess, it's differentiating itself from all these mathematical algorithms saying,\"We've got an algorithm  that actually does something, plays a game.\"Okay.Moving on.1979,  so I've actually skipped quite a few years there.Feel free to go  and find out what happened in between, but I'm just trying to find  some of the key milestones here.This is 1979, Backgammon.Now, I've always found backgammon  quite challenging to play and rarely win.Apparently it's quite easy for machines  because in 1979, they were able to beat a world champion  using a computer program.Maybe I should go and read  that article and I found out a bit more about how you can play Backgammon.Obviously, that's a game that has more chance  in it as well, which is interesting.Then just, I wanted to mention  The Computer Olympiadbecause this is an interesting  thing that popped up in 1989, created by Daniel Levy in London.It's still running today.This is a computer versus computer competition  where people submit algorithms,which will play a range of different games  against other computer algorithmsand they rank them.It's quite an interesting thing to go  and dig into and potentially,look at some of the algorithms  because a lot of them are open source and lots of different games are played.Going back to checkers again, in 1992,  this is where Schaefer comes in and published a world championship caliber  checkers playing game system.That's another important milestone,  so that you can see we're transitioninginto this idea that we are playing  and beating world championsas of the 1980s and 1990s.Let's go on to the big one, which is Deep Blue.1997, Deep Blue beats Gary Kasparov.There is a picture of the Deep Blue Computer  as far as I'm aware that I found on Wiki comments there.What can we say about this?Well, it is worth just saying  it was highly custom hardware.It had lots of processes.It's a highly parallel system, but it also had  specialized chess move computation processes.It could just run through all kinds  of different moves really, really fast, massive search algorithm really to search  for the optimal and search through the massive tree of possible moves  depending what the other player did as well.Yes, it's a really demonstration  of super computing power and what you can do with specialize hardware  and really a very important and famous milestone.Okay.Moving on.Scrabble was solved, if you like,  or at least world championship player, standard Scrabble AIs reported in 2002.What's interesting about Scrabble?If you don't know Scrabble, you have  to make place words onto the boardand you get given a set of letters  and you have to make up words.You don't know what the other players have.You don't know which letters they have,  you might have some idea based on what's gone out on the board.As the game progresses, you have more idea  about what letters they might have.There's also lots of different ways  to score points as well, so it's a really varied point scoring pattern.That's really quite a complicated game,  which is probably whyit was until it wasn't until 2002  that this world championship player was made.Then, going back  to Shafer's work on drafts and checkers, 2007 is completely solved checkers,  which means that it plays the best possible game every time.I think what the definition of solved  is and you can go and read the paperif you want to find out more,  but there's no point in playingagainst an AI checkers player anymore.In 2012, just bringing  this in as a slight variation on the theme so we've seen a lot board games.At this point let's just think about video games.2012 or 2009  was actually the first Mario AI competition.It was a small community of people  that were getting together at a conference and competing their AIs against each other  to see which one could do the best game of super Mario Brothers.I've got a picture of plumbing there  because I'm probably not allowed to show anything closer to an actual image  of the Nintendo Mario game, but there are plumbers and that was the theme,  this graphical theme of the game.This ran from 2009 to 2012.They give some reasons  in a later paper as to why it ended.One of the reasons, I think  they were getting a bit of heat from Nintendo.They weren't really able to use  the graphics and things on their websites, and also other competitions  were inspired by competition,more general competitions developed.Actually the community developed  as a whole of people building AIs to play games.That's an interesting thread to follow up  on as well if you're interested.Okay, let's skip forward to 2015  and look at a big milestonein the Atari video game playing systems.In 2015, this is the article we're going  to be looking at in lots of detailin the next few videos so we are going  to take a really deep dive into this,look at all the equations in the paper,  try and pick them apart, and then look at an implementation in code  where we can see exactly how it was doneand match that to the paper.We should get a really strong understanding  of how this one works.This was interesting  because it was published in Nature,which is a really important science journal where a lot of the big articles across the range  of science are published.You can see that it's can consider  very important topic.As we saw in the previous video,  I talked about motivations for this.One of the motivations for doing  this work is that is considered a stepping stone to general AI systems.If we can make a single AI that can play  a whole range of different games or learn to play a whole range of different games, then we are then in a good position  to then start looking at general AIs,maybe looking at more real world problems  and solving other problems.It's really a stepping stone,  but it's a very important one.You can see Deep Mind is a multibillion dollar company  as I understand it,which is part of the Alphabet Group along with Google.People are spending a lot of money  on this and a lot of computational resources and brain power to try and solve this problem,  so clearly it's definitely seen as a very important problem, 2015.Moving on, then the same company,  Deep Mind solved go if you like, or not solved it, but certainly came up with a world championship  standard famously player in 2016.There's a great video documentary about that, which you can find on YouTube.Then, switching back to some other types of games, so I don't play a lot of poker,  which is why I've still got the house.This is considered the hardest version  of poker apparently,so heads up,  no limit Texas Hold'em Poker, 2018.That's when an AI was able to play this game  to the standard and to beat  world championship standard players.This is really interesting  because you think about poker,there's a lot of hidden information in poker, so you don't know what cards the other people have.You don't know which cards  are still in the deck necessarily.You don't know whether someone is bluffing,  when they put their big bet down, whether they really have good cards  or whether they're just trying to beat you out.It's a really interesting game for AI's to solve and it's a very detailed description  in that paper that you can read.Again, look at the journal, it's science.It's science, one of the big journals in science.Clearly, this game-playing AI stuff is considered  a very important element of science as a whole.Let's just skip on to almost present data.2019, OpenAI reported on their Dota 5,  OpenAI Five bot, which was able to compete with world championship Dota players  in constrained circumstances.Remember, that research paper called,  When Will We Be Done With Games, where they talked about the fairness  of these competitions, and suggested things  that could make it fairer.Interestingly, yes, they do follow  some of those suggestions in this research, for example, putting it online  and letting anyone play against it.Moving to 2020,  and this is the final paper we'll look at.This is another paper from DeepMind,  where they actually were able tonot just play unlimited, I think  they played 47 or 49 games in the 2015 paper.In this one, they played the full set  of 57 Atari Games, which is considered the benchmark.They were able to show that their agent  could out-compete the scores or beat the scores of human playtesters,  the professional game playerswho they basically got to play all the games  as well as they could.This system was able to out-compete them.It's above human performance across all the games.Some of the games are really difficult,  have very long-term rewards for the play.You don't get any points until you've done  a whole load of really complicated actions,exploring a load of cabins or whatever.There's some really difficult games,  which don't indicate much to you as to how well you're doing,  unless you really have some understanding.It's a very important paper.As I say, an important stepping stone  towards this idea of general AI solving this more of a paradox  or at least addressing it.Okay.That was just a bit of a brain dump  of loads of important milestones, interesting milestones in game-playing AI.We've been through various decades, and talked  about a whole bunch of different games,and when AI met world standard  or World Championship standard in a lot of those systems  and when the first systems appeared, as well.Okay, so in this video, we've just been looking  at some important milestones in game playing AIs.As I said at the beginning, I encourage you  to follow your interests.You don't have to go off and learn about  every single one of these game-playing AIs.What you should do though,  is if you play a game and you think, \"Oh, how do they build an AI that plays that?\" Go and read the paper  and try and make sense of it, try and pick those equations apart.That's what I'm going to be doing for the Atari 2015,Atari DQN agent  in the next few weeks for you."
