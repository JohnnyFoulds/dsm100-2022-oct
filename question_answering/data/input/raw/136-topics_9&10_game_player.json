  "transcript": "[music]Welcome to week five.This is the final set of content on the game-playing AI,where are we going to be looking a little bit at the state of the artand also considering the ethics of game-playing AIs.Here are the learning objectives for this week.First of all, I want you to be able to present examplesof human competitive AI game players.I want you to be able to reason about the impact of human competitiveAI game players on human beings.Finally, I want you to be able to justify and explain the trendtowards general AI and discuss its potential impact on societyWe've kind of already considered this trend of general AIearlier in this content, but we're going to sort of revisit itand think about what that means for fairness,especially in games, and also what the ethical impactsof that all.To give you a quick heads up, this is an exampleof some of the references you're going to see.These are all the systems that people built after DQN in 2015,leading up to the state-of-the-art system as of 2020, which is agent 57,which is deep minds of all conquering Atari game-playing bot.We're also going to be looking at various other video games as well.That's it, welcome to week five.I hope you enjoy finding out using your sort of new knowledgeof how these reinforcement learning systems operateand applying that to looking at some new systems and seeinghow you can better understand them now that you've seen have this deep diveinto your own sort of reinforcement learning system.Good luck viewing all the content and doing the activities."
