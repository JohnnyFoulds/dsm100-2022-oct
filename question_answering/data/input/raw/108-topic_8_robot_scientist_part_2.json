  "transcript": "[music]So far, we have considered the very core agentsthat enable the robot scientistto carry out a full cycle of scientific investigation.The knowledge agentthat encodesall the underpinning knowledge for the robot scientist,the hypotheses generation agent to formulate new hypotheses to test,the planning agentto produce an experimental protocol to test those hypotheses,the automated robotic lab agentto execute the experimental protocol and record experimental results,the experimental results analysis agentto decide if the hypothesis were confirmed or not.In this mini-lecture, we will talk about additional agentsthat can enhance the performance of the robot scientist.For example, a meta-analysis agent.A meta-analysis agentcan collect information about all previous runs, results,and compare performance of other agents in what situations they work best.For example,what methods the hypothesis generation agent usedand what methods work best in what situations.If, at the next round,the meta-analysis agent can recognize the situation,then it can advise what method to use.We have implemented such an agent for the robot scientist, Eve.It is called Meta-QSAR.The main technique that the meta-analysis agent employsis meta-learning or learning to learn.It is a powerful approach for making learning more efficient.Meta-machine learningis learning about machine learning algorithms,the parameters,and what algorithms perform best on both datasets.The robot scientist Eve uses QSAR learningto predict chemical compounds by activity from its structure.Please refer to our open-access paperMeta-QSAR Large Scale Application of Meta-learningto Drug Design and Discoveryin the Journal of Machine Learningfor full detail.The QSAR task is given a target,usually a proteinand a set of chemical compounds,small molecules,with associated bioactivities,for example, inhibiting the target,to learn a predictive mapping from molecular representation to activity.The idea behind Meta-QSAR is the no free lunch theorem.There is no universal machine learning algorithmthat performs best on all datasets.Almost every form of statistical and machine learning methodhas been applied to learning QSARs.There is no agreed single best way of learning QSARs.Meta-learningis to learn what learning is better in what scenarios.A motivation for itis to understand the performance characteristicsof the main baseline machine learning methodscurrently used in QSAR learning.Meta-QSAR learning should be successfulbecause although all of the datasets have the same overall structure,they differin the number of data points or tested chemical compounds,the range and occurrence of features,compound descriptors,the type of chemical/biochemical mechanism that causes the bioactivityThese differences indicatethat different machine learning methodsare to be used for different kinds of QSAR datasets.The task is,for any given QSAR problem,select the best combination of QSAR and molecular representationthat maximizes a predefined performance measure.We can see that over 8,000 QSAR datasets.Features of these datasetsare like number of examples,mutual information, and some other features.We considered 18 base-level learning algorithms,including linear regression, support vector machines,neural networks, regression trees, and random forests.We measuredthe performance of each algorithm on each QSAR dataset.Before carrying out meta-learning,we have to carry out QSAR learning or baseline learning.We extracted nearly 3,000 targets, drug targets, from ChEMBL.It is a curated publicly available database.The number of chemical compounds per targetwas from 10 to about 6,000.There were several associated bioactivities:IC50, EC50, Ki, Kd, and their equivalents.The bioactivities have been normalizedby our collaborators from the University of Dundee.All compounds were represented by so-called fingerprints.It is binary tablesshowing presence, absence of each chemical or group.Among all algorithms, random forest was the best performer.It shows the best accuracy of predictionsin more than 1,000 targets out of nearly 3,000.The second best was SVM.If there is no any additional information about datasets and drug targets,then the best option is to employ random forest.Often, it would yield the best predictive results.However, in over 50% of cases,random forest would not be the best choice.Information about datasets and target propertiescan help to choose the best one,and this is meta-learning.To do meta-learning, we need to prepare meta-datasets.To form meta-datasets, we need to define their meta-features.We use characteristics of the datasets considered in the base studyand drug target propertiesas meta-features.We encoded meta-features in the form of an ontology.The Meta-QSAR ontology describes features of datasets,like number of compounds,mutual information,average minimum of the input,and features of targetsbecause each dataset is associated with a specific drug target.To form a meta-dataset for training meta-QSAR learning,we describedevery data set used at the base learning stagewith the defined meta-features.We calculated number of instances, mutual information, kurtosis, and so on,and other descriptions of the targets corresponding to each dataset,totaling over 2,000 of meta-features for over 8,000 of datasets.We splitthe meta-dataset on training and test meta-datasets,trained and tested our meta-QSAR learner.Then we evaluated this performanceby comparing the performancesof the best-suggested algorithm with the default.The default or baseline was random forestbecause it performed best at the first stage.Most of the algorithm predicted by our Meta-QSAR learningperform better than the default.Meta-learning can be successfully usedto select the best QSAR algorithms for a given dataset and drug targetto formulate hypotheses about potential drugs.The same meta-learning approachcan be applied for other problems, not only learning QSARs.In this mini-lecture,we can see that a meta-analysis agent for the robot scientist, Eve.The agent was constructedon the basis of analysisof 18 machine learning algorithmsapplied to over 8,000 of drug datasets.It was trained to predictwhat machine learning algorithms will work beston what type of dataset and molecular representation.Such an approach is called meta-learning,and it can be used for other types of learning."
