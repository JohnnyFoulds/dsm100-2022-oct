  "transcript": "[music]-In this mini-lecture,we will talk about the analysis of experimental resultsby Robot scientists.Rigorous analysis is required to make correct conclusions,bounds are considered hypothesis.Human scientists tend to be biased,naturally, they want their hypothesis to be confirmed.They also tend to overgeneralize their conclusions.Robot scientists are more objective in their investigations.Also, because every step of the discovery process is recorded,it is easy for an independent expert to check how conclusions were madeand if they're unbiased and generalized or not.Robot scientists can run thousands of experiments in parallel,non-stop.They produce lots of experimental data.They use machine learning to analyze experimental data.Interpretation of the result is importantfor understanding what the results meanand if the hypothesis were confirmed or not.It is not always to do so.This slide shows how the results of yeast growth experiments look like.Yeast culture is inoculated to plates with growth medium.The plates are scanned every 20 minutesto estimate how many cells are on the plate.The curves on the figures are yeast growth curves.The experiment is around for 48 hours,it is depicted on the horizontal axisand on the vertical axis are optical density measurementsthat corresponds to how many cells are on the plate.In blue, the growth rate of wild-type yeastunaltered with all genes.In red, yeast mutants strains with the gene removed.Interestingly, in some cases, a removal of a geneactually improves the growth rate of yeast.The growth scales have several critical parameters.For example, at doubling time,when the number of cells has doubled,maximum density and so on.These parameters along this information about yeast strainsand added metabolites are put into a table for processingby machine learning tools.Please note thaton these figures the names of genes are represented by different IDs.For example, S and F cell is the same as YLR or 25W.Unfortunately, using different IDs for the same entity is typicalfor biomedical research.There is even a jokebiologist would rather share a toothbrush than a gene name.That is why assigning all entities with globally unique identifiers like UTIsis critical for the interpretation of the resultsand sharing information.Robot scientists then use decision treesto decide if the growth of yeast strains was affectedby the addition of specified metabolites or not.As you could see from the growth curves figures,the difference between the growth of a wild typeand a mutant can be subtle.Since experiments were run by the automated system,it was easy to replicate them.The robot scientists replicated all experiments many times,producing many data points for the analysis.This enables the detection of subtle differencesin a statistically significant manner,which would not be possible to do otherwise.Experimental results are available by following the linkat the bottom of the slide.It is important to rememberthat experimental results are only a proxyfor the initial hypothesis.It is impossible to experiment with genesand satisfy his strains with genes deleted or used.Experimental data are about those strains, not about genes.Therefore, an extra step of inference is requiredto make conclusions about the initial hypothesis.Since the hypothesis includes gene enzyme classwas replaced by three proxy hypothesis about eating metabolites,first conclusions have to be made about proxy hypothesis.If they were confirmed or not,and only reason about gene functionsdeciding if a particular hypothesis has been confirmed or notmay be difficult.For example, three different metabolites may restore mutant yeast growth.However, experiment shows that only two metabolites,indeed restored the growth, but one did not.Overall the experimental results were not fully conclusive.In consultation with the domain experts,hypothesis acceptance ratios were set upwhen it is scientifically viable to accept the hypothesisand when it is not.It is important to understand and rememberthat many scientific results are like thatthey are not fully conclusive,and they may be about some proxies,not the real entities of interest.The robot scientist Eve walked on identifying potential drugs,leads for malaria.Eve [?] lab experiments with purposedly engineered yeast strains,chimeras.Yeast has been outed to include proteins of interestfrom both humans and two major malaria variants.In this way, experimental results could indicatewhat chemical compounds are harmful to both malaria variantsbut not to humans.That is why what we want from a new drug to kill malaria,but not the human.Experimental results were analyzedwith the use of Random Forest, support vector machines,and many other machine learning algorithms.Random Forest was one of the best performing algorithmson such data.You can read more about these experiments,how they were designed and analyzed,follow the link to our Open Access paper at the bottom of this slide.In this mini-lecture,we looked at how experimental results were analyzed by the robot scientist.Various machine learning algorithms were usedto decide if initial hypothesis about gene functionswere confirmed or not.Such automated decisions were then verified manuallyby conventional biomedical experimentation.Many of hypothesis produced by the robot scientistshave been confirmed,therefore, robot scientists automatenot only production of valuable biomedical data,but also automate the analysis and repetition."
