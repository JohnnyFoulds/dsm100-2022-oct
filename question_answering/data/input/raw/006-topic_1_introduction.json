  "transcript": "-In this mini lecture,we will talk about artificial agentsand what makes an agent rational.An agent is anything that perceives its environment through its sensorsand acts upon that environment through actuators.In this sense, we can view a human as an agent.A human has sensors like eyes, earsand actuators like arms, legs, voice cordsto act in their surrounded environment. A robotic agent may have cameras, voice recognition,there is a lot of work on smile recognition and electronic tongueor haptic inputs, outputs.Robots can go beyond human perceptions.For example, they can have infrared camerasand they can see what humans can't see.An agent can be a software agent or a bot.It can receive keystrokes or a set of data, files, a sensory inputand act on the environment by, for example, displaying on the screen,writing to filesor it can send messages to other agents,software, or robotic agents. In this case, we are talking about multi-agent communication.Let us consider a simple example,a vacuum cleaner agent world.If I operate a vacuum cleaner,then the vacuum cleaner is not an agent,the human is.If a vacuum cleaner can act on its own,then we can consider it as an agent.In this example, the world is very simple and restricted.There are only two locations, A and Band there can be dirt or no dirt.The environment is locations A and B.Sensors,the cleaner agent perceives which square it is in and if there is dirt or not.Actions,move left, move right, suck up the dirt or do nothing.Other important concepts arepercept sequence is the complete history what agent ever perceived.Agent's behavior is a mapping of any percept sequence to an action.An agent can make a decision about the next actionbased on the current environment stateor based on any part or a whole history of percept sequences.In theory, we can construct a tablethat maps all possible percept sequences to some action.In practice, it is rarely possiblebecause the world is not complicated than the vacuum cleaner worldwith only two locations.It is virtually impossible to list all percept sequences.All searching through them would take too longto decide what to do in what situation.What is a rational agent?One that behaves rationally.How to evaluate that?We need to define a performance measure.A criterion of success.Then, there can be many performance measures.For example, amount of dirt sucked in eight hours,then an agent can maximize itby sucking the dirt up, then disposing it and sucking it up again.Or a performance measure can be to minimize electricity consumptionwhile maximizing use.Number of squares are cleaned at each time point.It can be a complex measure.We can also add minimize noise.Rationality also implies knowledge of the environment.In our example, the cleaner agent knows about the locations.Otherwise, it is hard to expect rational behavior.For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that maximizes its performance measure.In many situations, an agent will have only partial knowledge of the environmentor none at all.Then, information gathering through exploration is critical.Another important aspect of rational behavior is learningas much as possible from what it perceives.It can be a complex process.For example, learning from sensor data often involves machine learning. A rational agent should be autonomous.A vacuum cleaner should be able to decide what to doand when without control from humans. Autonomy and independence may not be required from the start.An agent first may need to learn about the environment actions and the effectsand only then, act autonomously.In this mini lecture,we talked about rational agents, rational behavior and how to measure it.We considered a very simple example.In reality, of course, agents and their environments are far more complexbut they still can act rationallyand we can measure its performance."
