  "transcript": "[music]In this mini lecture, we will look at a toy robot scientist.The robot scientist, AI system, is highly complex,perhaps the most complex system in existencegiven its advanced AI components, integrated with machine learning toolsand also automated laboratory equipment.Our toy robot scientist will help you to better understand the inside workingsof the main system.Firstly, I will remind you about the main componentsof the robot scientist.The concept of the robot scientist reflects the typical cycleof scientific discovery.To automate the discovery process, an artificial scientist needsbackground knowledge encoded in machine processable form,an inference engine to formulatenew hypothesis, an inference engineto design experiments to test those hypothesis,a real physical system to execute those experiments,a data analytics component to decide if hypothesis were confirmed or not.New experimental data in conclusions about the hypothesis can be addedto the background knowledge base, and the cycle can be repeatedagain and again till a target is achieved,or the system runs out of resources.Each of those components is a complex system,which may have subcomponents that are also far from being simple.Moreover, this components are not located in the same place.Machine learning software runs in France as the lab system is in Sweden.Each of these components and subcomponentscan be viewed as an agent,and the robot scientist system can be viewedas a multi-agent distributed system.Our toy robot scientist is designed to assist in drug discovery.It can recommend what chemical compounds are likely to be drugs.Our toy is a multi-agent system that can carry outthe most essential parts of the discovery process.It has knowledge agent that can accessa data set and update its knowledge model.Hypothesis generation agent.Hypotheses are generated from the background knowledgeabout drug design and available chemical data.Hypotheses are only guesses and they need to be tested.A planning agent designs experiments to test the formulated hypothesis.It needs to know not only what to test, but also what materialsand equipment are available.It passes an experimental protocol to the lab agent,a sequence of actions with instructions about devices, parameters, timings,and so on.The robotic lab agent follows the protocol, runs experiments,and records observations, experimental results.The robotic lab passes the experimental datato the results interpretation agent.This agent can decide if the hypothesis will conform or not.New data and new knowledge about confirmed or rejected hypothesisare added to the knowledge base and data sets.The new hypothesis can be formed, and so on.Our toy robot scientist has only a few agents to enable themthe main discovery process.It can be enhanced by many other agents.For example, a meta-analysis agent,a collaboration agent, a monitoring agent,an external services agent, a model agent, and an explanation agent.A meta-analysis agent can collect informationabout all previous rounds, results, and compare performance of other agents.In what situations they work best?For example, does the planning agent designgood enough experiments?Can the results interpretation agent consistently make decisionsbased on the produced observations?If not, what needs to be changed?This is a highly intelligent behavior.Sophisticated reasoning over an elaborate knowledge baseis required to implement such an agent.A collaboration agent can be added to support a team of robot scientists,or a team of human and robot scientists.It is like a next level of a multi-agent system,a team of multi-agent systems.This will require orchestration of the goals, knowledge basis,complex scheduling of experiments, sharing outputs, and of course,they can be communication problems.Having a monitoring agent is always a good idea.Such an agent can monitor and record everything what is happening.When hypothesis were passed to the planning agent,how long did it take to produce experimental protocols?Is everything all right in the lab?Are there enough consumables for the next bunch of experiments?This information is essential for learning from the whole processfor the meta-analysis.It is also pivotal for transparency and accountability of AI systems.For sharing of also data and knowledge.An external services agent can be an interface for external users.For example, they can be permitted to submit their hypothesis to testby the automated lab agent.External users will receive not only experimental data,but also conclusions made by the results interpretation agent.This is the vision of a lab automation cloud.It doesn't matter to external users where or on what equipmentthe hypothesis were tested.If they have accurate, well-annotated experimental resultsand conclusions, then they will be happy to usethe service.A model agent can substantially enhance the intelligenceof the robot scientist system.It can work not only with data and rules, but also with executablecomputational models, run simulations, and enhance productionof interesting hypothesis, and also interpretation of the results.For example, if there is a suitable computational modelabout mechanism of a particular disease, then this knowledge can be usedto formulate hypothesis and more targeted selectionof chemical compounds to test.An explanation agent can explain to userswhy and how these conclusions were made,and not answers.It can explain to external AI developers, how the system components work,and to biologists and chemists, what experiments are run and why.We can imagine many other agents that can enhance our toy.In the real world, some of such agents exist,and some are not.For example, there are no communication agentsto support collaboration of a team of scientists.The work on producing explanations is still in its infancy.In this mini-lecture, we talked about the toy robot scientist,what agents it has and what agents might enhance it further.Our toy robot scientist work on drug design problems,and it requires a knowledge base about drug design,and drug design datasets as an input.It can formulate hypothesis about what chemical compoundsmay be the potential drugs, design experimentsto test this hypothesis, run experiments and analyze the results."
