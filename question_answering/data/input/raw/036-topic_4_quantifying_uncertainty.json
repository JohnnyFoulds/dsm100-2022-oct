  "transcript": "-We will start this mini-lecture from discussing what probability is.There are different approachesto the source and status of probability numbers.The most common approaches arefrequentist or objectivist approach.The position is that numbers can come only from experiments.If we test 100 people and find 20 of them have cavitiesthen probability of having cavities is 0.2.In this case, probabilities are determined by a statistical approach.The problem is that the approach is that we do not always haveexperimental resultsand some of the experiments are not possible.For example, what is the probability that Boris Johnsonwill be reelected as the Prime Minister?It is impossible to run experiments to determine such a probability.Bayesian approach is to assign a number based on our knowledgeor beliefs.This approach is subjective.Bayesian approach is based on Bayes theorem.It is also known as Bayes network, belief network, decision network.Bayesian model, probabilistic directed a cyclic graphical model,probabilistic graphical model.For networks the possible rules are assignmentsof values to variables.Bayesian network is a well-developed representationof uncertain knowledge.Bayes theorem provides a formal way of representing and calculatingsuch probabilities.If we consider two events, A and B stands,the Bayes theorem states that probability of A given Bis equal probability of B given A multiplied on probabilityof A divided probability by B.Of course, probability of B should not be equal zero.The probability A given B is the likelihood of event Aoccurring given that B is true.Probability of B given A accordingly is the likelihood of the event Boccurring given set A is true.Probability of A and probability of B are the probabilities of observingA and B respectively.Prior probability A represents what is originally believedbefore observing B.Posterior probability P of A given Btakes this new information, new observation of B into account.Bayes theorem can be rewritten in hypothesis, evidence notation.This notation is useful for understanding the Bayesian reasoning.When some evidence E is becoming available,we can change our beliefs.If more evidence would become available,we can change our beliefs again and so on.Changing a belief about one event can lead to changesin beliefs about other related events.We can propagate such changes in our beliefs network followingthe Bayesian approach.The change probabilities can be pre-calculated in accordancewith the Bayes theorem.Bayesian network or BN for short is a graphical structureconsisting of nodes representing random variables or events,and directed arcs, links, connected nodes.Now we will consider an example Bayesian network.You can ask Alexa to send email to your boss.We can enhance Alexa by developing a decision support system that enablesto ask Alexa to contact your bossand to decide about the best way of doing that.Maybe by email, phone, or maybe by Skype.We'll have to pass to such a decision support system,your knowledge about ways to connect to contact your boss.Something like that.I can contact my boss by email or Skype.I can get a response or not.If she is in office,and that happens only 50% of the time as she is often awayon business trips,then she will respond in 50% of cases.The boss usually doesn't check Skype messageswhen in officebut checks it 50% of the time when not in office.The boss usually checks email messages when in office and is unlikely to check itwhen not in office.The boss is very likely to respond if he has checked both Skype and email.The boss is likely to respond if has checked Skype or email.The boss doesn't respond if has not checkedeither Skype or email.We can represent this example as a simple Bayesian networkthese four nodes.The immediate question is how to construct a good Bayesian network?What entities to select as nodes.In the background knowledge, we have such entities as boss,me, email, Skype, office.The advice is to select an ordered list of random variableswhen causes received effects.How to deal with knowledge gaps.Are there other factors influencing the likelihood of response?How to deal with uncertainties.How to represent usually checks likely to respond.What links to use to connect the nodes.Contact, check, respond.These are all good questions, and it is preciselywith what knowledge representation and knowledge modeling approachesare dealing with.It is possible to construct different Bayesian networksfor the same problem.In this example, we selected in office, Skype, email, and response as the nodes.Probabilities are great to represent our knowledgeabout such events as the boss is in office in 50% of cases.Such knowledge is based on the previous experienceas is of objective nature.Probabilities are also great to represent uncertain knowledge like,boss usually does not check email messages when in office.We do not have any numerical statistical estimatesbut we can assign an arbitrary probability maybe 0.1to represent the uncertain expression, usually does not check.In this way, we can assign a probability distributionfor each node in Bayesian network.The node, in office represents the event or a random variable,the boss is in office.This variable has two possible values, yes or no.Boss [?] equal likelihood.Probability of boss is in office is 0.5 and probability of bossis not in office is also 0.5.The node Skype represents that random variable.The boss checks Skype messages.It has four possible values,they can be represented as conditional probabilities.Probability checks Skype given boss is in office is 0.1.Probability checks Skype given boss is not an office is 0.5.Probability does not check Skype given boss is in office is 0.9,and probability doesn't check Skype given boss is not in office is 0.5.Similarly, the node email represents a random variable,the boss checks email messages.It has four possible values that can be representedas conditional probabilities.Probability of checks emails given boss is in the office is 0.8.Probability of checks emails given boss is not in office is 0.2.Probability doesn't check email given boss is in office is 0.2and probability doesn't check email given boss is not in office is 0.8.The not response represent our knowledge since the boss is very likely to respondif has checked both Skype and email.The boss is likely to respond if she has checked Skype or email.The boss doesn't respond if she has not checked either Skypeor email.The random variable responses has the following possible values.Probability response given checks both Skype and email is 0.99.Probability of responsegiven checks Skype and not email is 0.9.Probability response checks email and not Skype is 0.9and probability response doesn't check neither Skypenor email is 0.01.If we need we can extend our Bayesian Network.In a company, the messages is usually sent to a management teamand they are sent using a common email addressor address of director or deputyor they can be sent on Skype account only that the director has access to it.If at least one of either director or deputy receives the check message,then it will usually be responded.We can easily expand the Bayesian Network by adding a new node,deputy.We also can express the likelihood of responding by assessmentof probabilities.We used Bayesian Network to represent our knowledge about contacting the boss.Our Bayesian Network can be used to answer various questionsabout contacting the bossand Bayes theorem provides the means for calculating correspondingconditional probabilities.For example, if suppose has responded to your message,Skype, or email,what is the chance that she's in the office?We can calculate this probability using the Bayes theoremand other formulas, butit is tedious even for a small Bayesian Network.For a large Bayesian Network with hundreds or even 1000s of nodes,it's not practical.Instead, we can implement it in Bayesian.Bayesian Networks also can be implemented in many other languages not only Bayesian.For example in R or prolog.In this mini-lecture, we learned about Bayes theoremand how it can be used to represent background knowledgeas Bayesian Networks."
