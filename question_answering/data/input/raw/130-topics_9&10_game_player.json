  "transcript": "[music]Welcome to week four.It's finally time to build and train this AI game-playing system.Let's just look at the learning objectives,and then we'll get some previews of what we're goingto be seeing this week.First of all, at the end of this week, you should be able to explainhow the DQN agent architecture and learning system is expressedas a working program.Secondly, you should be able to evaluate the performanceof the DQN agent.You need to be able to know how you can test whether this thingis actually working or not.Finally, I'm going to show you how to deploy a pre-trained neural networkand use it to play games in real-time.That's important because you may not have the facilities to train this thing,but I do and I've trained this thing for you.I'm going to show you that once someone's trainedthe network for you, it's easy to implement thatand deploy that in your code.What about the previews?Well, first of all, the big thing we're going to be doing this weekis we're going to be looking at code, but really importantly,it's really vital that you make the connection between the maths equationsthat are in the paper and the actual implementation in code.I'm going to very carefully make the connectionbetween these complicated loss function and exactly how that's implementedin the code, which line relates to which, so you can see that the codereally directly implements exactly what's in that equation.Then secondly, what we're going to see is the AI playing a video game.You can see here is a sort of reasonably well-trained AI playing Break Wall, which is our version of Breakout.Yes, it's not doing too badly, it's scoring a few points.That's what we're going to be looking at.Eventually, you will have this running on your system at the end of this week.Okay, great. Welcome to week four.I'm looking forward to seeing how you get onwith the actual implementation and see if anyone can train a better modelthan I can to play Break Wall, and I hope you enjoy seeingthe full implementation of the DQN agent."
