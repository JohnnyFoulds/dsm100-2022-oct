  "transcript": "-In this mini-lecture, we'll consider a communication agentfor the robot scientist.It was developed for Eve to enable communications mainlybetween machine learning tools and automated robotic lab,and also start to work on communication between human and robot scientist.Why communication is important in multiagent systems?In multiagent environments, agents can act independently,they can act as a swarm, and then they don't communicate.Or, they can be competitors, for example, playing a game.In this case, they will benefit from knowing about another agentas much as possible, or they can compete withoutany such knowledge, but the more they know, the better strategiesthey can choose.Or, they may cooperate.Again, they can cooperate without knowing what others are doing,so it can be quite swarm-like, but if they know what shared goalsare and what other agents are doing, then it will be more intelligent behavior.The best way to cooperate on achieving a shared goal is by knowingthe shared goal and to share knowledge, not only about the goal,but also the work where they operate.Again, each agent can have its own knowledge model of the word,what they know about the word, and they can act based on it.They can exchange this knowledge model,so other agent know what other agents assume and what they know,or they can have one single knowledge model representingjoin knowledge about this word, so different scenarios as possible.They also need to know what other agents are doing.The more they know, the better strategies they canchoose and more chances of achieving this shared goal.It is especially important in dynamic environments becauseeverything can change.The goal can change, the world can change,knowledge about this world can change, and what agents are doing also can change.They need to regularly update this knowledge.The best way of doing this, by communicating.What communication involves?What is important to consider?Of course, content what they're communicating, so what knowledgethey need to exchange, then, an agreed protocol for this exchange.What steps?What information?What they need, and mode of communication, how they're doing it?Is it via text messages?Is it voice or some other means?It is a hot area of research.There is a lot of work on development of such protocols,languages, and whole series.In this mini-lecture, I will tell you about our work on developmentof a communication agent for the Robot Scientist, Eve.This is a very simple agent and because it's of a scientist,we know what communication is about.The communication is about these basic steps of scientific discovery.We call this protocol SciCom, Scientific Communication Protocol.It's in current minimalistic form.Yes, it requires a lot of extension and future, and I willtell you about future plans.What we developed so far, it's a protocol that is focusingon exchange information about the most critical aspectsof scientific discovery.It is all about request for experimentsand communicating results of that experiments.We define syntax and semantics for such communication.It is based on the ontology Eve, that we specifically developedto support the robot scientist Eve.I will introduce you with this ontology, so what is there.Eve ontology provides formal logical descriptionsof most essential entities that are important for experiments,experiments that Eve can run.It defines typical experiments.For example, the most typical experiment,what we call Optical Density Measurement Experiments.It's experiments that takes these input yeast strains,add different chemicals, possibly other factors like glucose,maybe change oxygen concentration, and by the end,it measures optical density.Optical density is measured by light going through the platewhere this culture is being grown.If it cannot penetrate much, it means that there is a lot of growth,a lot of yeast cells, so measurements will be different.If yeast doesn't grow well, then measurements will show it.This is the most basic measurement and the whole experimentwe called Optical Density Measurement Experiment.Eve defines all essential components of such an experiment.Then, Eve ontology also defines possible experimental factors,so what can be derived in such experiments?For example, metabolites or these chemicals, what can be added?How much?Then, what else can be changed, medium?It's quite important on what this yeast culture is growing.It can be rich medium, it can be defined, it can be minimal,so growth depends on this medium.For example, duration, it can be grown for two days, for four days,and this experimental factor, and our control can decideor Eve can decide, so robot scientists can decide.What can be changed?These changes can be done for the whole plate or it can be donefor each individual well on this plate.If using 384 wells on one plate and each well can havedifferent metabolites, and it can have differentyeast strains, so it's essentially different experiment in each well.Something can be changed on well level, something on plate level.It all needs to be described and defined, so Eve can then make these changes.What is considered as input?What is input to experiment?The main, what it experiments with is yeast strains.What are outputs?Optical density regions, I already explained what it is.It also can take fluorescent measurements or it canmeasure concentrations of chemical or glucose.It all needs to be defined and described.What are capabilities of the lab?If we will talk about different labs, they can be different equipment,and they can be different measurements and different capabilities.It needs to be defined and encoded in machine-processable form,so then experiments can be planned.This ontology was used to define all important entities about experiments.Here's example of experimental factor at plate level.What is important to know?For example, plate can have a lid, and if it can put the lid onand it can remove lid, it's actually quite important.If lid is on, then less oxygen, and yeast is growing differently.If it's exposed to oxygen, then measurements can be very different.Also, liquid can accumulate on these lids.This is important to record and also to make a decision if lid is on or off,or maybe for some part of experiments, lids are on and when they are off.Then, shaking.Especially when metabolites are added, so it's quite important to distributethem evenly and incubators where yeast is growing [?],so you can put shaking.Then, how strongly to shake?For how long?It all needs to be decided then recorded, and also shaking can be different.For example, we have serious troubles when experimentscouldn't be repeated for a long time.Every time the results were different.It's because this shaking moment was changed, so if it's not orbital,then yeast was forming pellets on the bottom and all measurementswhich is completely different.Every parameter is very important and it needs to be definedand it needs to be recorded.Then, how frequently to read.Again, there are some minimum and maximum.How often, it's possible, or when it's already doesn't make sense,if it is one to two hours, so too many things can changeduring this period, so it's possible to miss something important.Again, the Scientology defines it.Then, temperature, what is minimum temperature the labcan have or incubator can have?What is maximum?What is recommended temperature?The same duration and even plates, it can be very different.Different plates, different culture, and obviously, everything,every minor detail can affect the experimental results.Here, example of, what should be recorded and defined at a well plate?At each plate, for example, concentration of glucose, so it's food-free yeast.It can be zero, no glucose added or you can just have onlyglucose, recommended is 10%.Then, medium.This is standard, the medium YPD.There are many other medium where yeast can grow.As in any good experiment, we will include positive and negative control.One way of including the control is to add wild-type,and even wild-types, they can be different.Here is recommended strain to include as control.Then, volume.How much is possible to put in one well?Again, minimum, maximum and also this increment is important,how much it can be changed.What equipment is capable of handling?Then, other factors, so here are examples, but I think yougot the idea that any experiment is complex and it's importantto record about it as much as possible.Implementation of the SciCom protocol.As I explained, it's based on Eve ontology that defines a standard experiment.The protocol actually enforces recording only differences,deviations from this standard protocol.On the right, you see implementation in YAML.YAML is a data serialization language and it's quite easy to understand,not only to robot scientists, but also to human, so it's quite readable.Each experiment is assigned to these, an ID, and then just if it'sstandard experiment, yes, and then only differences, of course.Like strains can be different and then it's specified with strainsand what outputs are, so what to record.Outputs, again, so standard recording will be optical density measurement,and so it's like default.Here you see output glucose and ethanol.It's like additional optical density recordings will be doneand if additional outputs required, and this is what this message will convey.Most likely it's some simulation, machine learning simulationwith simulation done with Moodle and they would like to checksomething in real lab, some predictions.Will it be confirmed or not?They need to make this request for an experiment,grow these real strains and observe what has happened,and then if predictions were confirmed or not.If not, then we'll go back and think again.Something was wrong, take this new data into accountand run simulation again.This is how it's working.This communication protocol supported the real projectis AdaLab project, your IPN project.Five universities were involved and the communicationwas between this various machine learning toolsthat were developing computational model of complex biological systemto understand some biological phenomena.There was a lot of computational simulationand then the simulations need to be tested if they're correct or not.It was like a cycle, get more data, and do better simulation, update model.Again, make prediction, check in the lab if it's true or not.We also attempted this communication between human and robot scientists.Would human who input and say, \"Recommend it,\" would the controlsto select some experimental settings like concentration durationsare sometimes hard to better represent experimental results.This was input from a few months back from robot scientists.It's mostly results of experiments.Of course, this is not enough and in future if think seriouslyabout robot human scientists working together as a team,then they need better communication.In these scenarios again, communication is easier becauseyou know what they're going to communicate about.They're going to communicate about hypothesis.They're going to communicate about experimental design,about maybe final models.We develop this very foundational cycle as was the duration,but it is obvious that it needs extending, especially if it can handlecommunication about hypothesis.It would be good not only to pass this hypothesis, how it's done now,but also explain why this hypothesis to test.What will it give?Why not others?How it was selected?The more information, the better.Again, this hypothesis maybe can bechanged like first results started to show.You don't need to wait two days.For example, yeast usually is being grown for two days,maybe you can updraft experiments early if results are not as expectedand shortens the cycles to amend and start something new.There are many possible scenarios.It is something for the future work.In this mini-lecture, we looked at the communication agent.Such agents are important to support communication betweendifferent components, between different agents.[?] come together on a shared goal or even if they're competitors,they still benefit from knowing more about the charts.The particularly interesting aspect is to support communicationbetween humans and intelligent agents.In this mini-lecture we can see that the communication withinthe robot scientist Eve, is between agents in Eve,machine learning and robotic part of Eve,and robot scientistsbut also between human"
