  "transcript": "[music]In this mini lecture,we will talk about what AI isand what makes an intelligent agent intelligent.We will discuss different approaches to defining AI.For example, we will talk about Turing test approachand if an AI system can pass the Turing test.To start with, it's important to stress thatthere is no an agreed definition of AI.One of the reasons of that is thatthere is no an agreed definition of what intelligence is.However, we all generally agree what intelligent behavior is.For example, playing chess, GO, driving a car,learning new concepts, making decisions, such behavior requires intelligence.There are two major types of AI.Narrow AI, AI applied to a specific domain like language translators,virtual assistants, self-driving cars, chatbots, recommendation engines,intelligent spam filters.Examples are Watson, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant.Another type is general AI,AI that can perform a wide variety of unrelated tasks.It can learn to solve tasks for new problems.This level is not achieved yet.We will consider what AI is from four perspectives.Acting humanly- The Turing test approach.Thinking humanly- The cognitive modeling approach.Thinking rationally- The \"law of thought\" approach.Acting rationally- The rational agent approach.Turing test was proposed by Alan Turing in 1950,and it remains relevant 70 years later.It provides operational definition of intelligence.A computer passes the test if a human interrogator,after posing written questions,can't tell whether the answers came from a person or a computer.Can AI pass a Turing test?To pass a Turing test, AI needs the following capabilities,natural language processing to communicate with the interrogator,knowledge representation to store and process what it knows,automated reasoning to use as thought knowledge to answer questionsand to draw conclusions,machine learning to detect and extrapolate patterns.The classical Turing test does not include physical context.The so-called total Turing test includes a video signal sourcethat interrogator can test perceptual abilities,and also an interrogator can pass physical objects through the hatch.To pass the total Turing test,an AI system additionally to the listed aboutcapabilities needs computer vision to perceive the objects and roboticsto manipulate objects and to move about.These six disciplines are the core disciplines of AI.AI researchers do not focus on passing the Turing test,instead, they're focusing on underlying technologies.In this module, we will particularly focus on knowledge representation,automated reasoning, and robotics.There are other modules in our programsthat are focusing on other core disciplines like machine learning,natural language processing, and data visualization.The cognitive modeling approach to AI is focusing on understandinghow humans think and attempting to build AI that thinks like a human.The interdisciplinary field of cognitive sciencebrings together computer models from AIand experimental techniques from psychology.There are interesting developments in this exciting area of research.For example, check open access research papersby my colleague from Goldsmiths, Max Garagnani.I provided some links for you.A subfield of cognitive science is human-like computing.Human-like computing research aims to endow machineswith human-like perceptual reasoning and learning abilities,which support collaboration and communication with human beings.This approach is in contrast to more conventional approacheswhere AI systems rely on their ability to learn from huge numbers of examples.Like Tesla Autopilot program is built on 780 million months of travel data.AlphaGo probably played hundreds of millions of gamesprior to beating Go professional, Lee Sedol.Humans, on the other hand, can extrapolate from a small number of examples.Human-like computing is a new area of researchand it is focusing on the development of AI systemsthat could produce explainable human-like reasoning.Such systems would be beneficial in many application areas.Thinking rationally approach.This approach dates back to Aristotle,the Greek philosopher who attempted to codify the laws of reasoning.His laws provided patterns for argumentative structuresthat always yield correct conclusions.For example, Socrates is a man.All man are mortal.Therefore, Socrates is mortal.Such laws are the foundation of the research into logic.An intelligent system needs the capability of \"thinking\" or logical reasoning.Acting rationally approach.A rational agent is an agent, be it a computer program,a robot, or a human, anyone or any sense that can actthat acts to achieve the best outcome.All the capabilities required for the Turing testare also required for an agent to act rationally.Knowledge representation and reasoningenables the agent to accumulate knowledge and make decisionbased on what is known.NLP enables communication,and learning is critical for improving performance.In this module, we will be mainly focusingon the rational agent approach to AI.Because it is generic,we can apply it to robots and computer programs,to simple and complex systems, and also multi-agent systems.It is amenable to scientific developments.AI systems can be developed as rational agents,and their performance can be measured.It is practical.Agents are acting in concrete environments,like in car manufacturing,medical diagnosing, or personal intelligent assistants.In this mini lecture, we considered different approachesto defining what AI research is,approaches that are focusing on development of AI systemsthat act and thinks as humans,and also approaches that are focusing on development of AI systemsand act and think as rational agents.All these approaches are important and extremely interesting.However, in this module, we will be mainly focusingon the rational agent approach to AI.We will consider AI systems as rational agentsand how to build them and how to work with them."
