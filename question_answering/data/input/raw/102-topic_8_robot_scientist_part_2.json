  "transcript": "-In this mini lecture, we will talk about how abduction can be usedto generate a hypothesis.Abduction is a mechanism that can take us outside what is already known.It requires further testing and verification.But that is a mechanism to advance our knowledge.We will consider how the robot scientist, Adam, used abductionto formulate new hypothesis.Firstly, I will remind you what deduction and abduction are.In deduction, we have a rule, if P, then Q, and an assertion P.Therefore, we can deduce Q, if our rule and assertion are correct,then the conclusion is guaranteed to be correct too.In abduction, we have the same rule, if P, then Q, and an observation Q.Therefore, we can abduce P.P is a possible explanation of the observation Q.On this slide you can see examples of deductive and abductive reasoning.Rule: All swans are white.Fact: Bruce is a swan.Deduction: Bruce is white.Rule: All swans are white.Fact: Daffy is white.Abduction: Daffy is a swan.Unfortunately, both inferences, deductive and abductive, are incorrect.Indeed, before the discovery of Australia, people thoughtthat all swans are white, but then, they discovered that swans can be black.It is critical to remember that our knowledge may be incorrect.There is also a lot what we don't know.New knowledge can be discovered and confirmed throughobservations and experimentation, and then our knowledge,in form of rules and facts, can be updated.Using updated knowledge, we can make new deductiveand abductive conclusions.The robot scientist, Adam, used abduction to generate hypotheses.The application area of the robot scientist on themis functional genomics.Background knowledge is a yeast metabolic pathways model.It is a graph representing chemical reactions.The metabolic graph was encoded in prolog, in First Order Logic.Yeast has about 6,000 genes and their functionsare similar to those in humans.It is still unknown what genes are responsible for some of the reactions.It is possible that several genes are responsible for one reactionand one gene may be responsible for several reactions.On this slide, you see a fragment of a yeast metabolic graph.Nodes are chemicals, their IDs are in red, links are chemical reactions.These chemical reactions are controlled by genes.Controlling a chemical reaction is a gene function.It is how genes controls the production of the necessary for the cell elements.On the figure, genes are depicted in blue, starting with the letter Y.You can see that some reactions have several genes associatedwith them, and some links have none.For example, that are no genes specified for link between chorismateand Prephenate in the middle of the graph.A metabolic graph represents functioning of a yeast cell.For a cell to survive, it needs to receive and also to output certain elements.It can receive the necessary elements from the growth media,or it can synthesize them.The input to these metabolic pathways model isglycerate 2-phosphate, see the depicted in green on the top of the slide.That is glucose, food for the yeast cell.The cell must output tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan,see in green on the bottom of the slide.If a cell does not output this element, or doesn't receive food, it will die.If a cell doesn't receive enough food, and cannot output all the elements,its growth can be affected.How robot scientist formulate hypothesis about gene functions.For link between chorismate and Prephenate it consideredpossible candidate genes from the list of 6,000 genesand also their combinations.He tries to find genes that can control production of Prephenateand ultimately, biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan.The search space consisting of 6,000 genesand their combinations is huge.Adam has access to bioinformatics databases,and he uses them to reduce the options by finding:What enzyme catalyzes the considered reaction?What genes are responsible for that catalyzer in other organisms?And, homologous genes in yeast; homologous means,that they are evolutionary similar.After abducing possible options, it inserts candidates to itslogical model and runs reasoner to check if Prephenate can be synthesized.In the considered example, Adam abducedthe gene YPR060C might be responsible for this reaction.You can see on this slide, the question mark is replacedby the name of the gene.It is only plausible explanation, an abduction, and not necessarily correct.It makes sense logically and computationally,but it has to be experimentally validated before it can beadded to these metabolic pathways model.Our knowledge is limited, not always accurate,and this is how it is updated:Through informed guesses and experimentationto confirm or disapprove them.In this mini lecture, we highlighted the differencebetween deductive and abductive reasoning.We discussed that our knowledge is incomplete;it has gaps and inaccuracies.It requires updating and filling the gaps.We inspected how the robot scientist, Adam,abduced hypothesis about yeast gene functions.Background knowledge was represented in logic,to formulate new hypothesis.and robot was able to reason over it"
